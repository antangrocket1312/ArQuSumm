Why hasn't Kyoraku replaced his vacant captain's seat and vacant vice captain's seat in squad 8 yet? Squad 8 is essentially being run by [this guy](http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Tatsufusa_Enj%C5%8Dji) right now....a guy that was beaten by Chad in the SS arc....it just doesn't seem logical to leave an entire division without a captain or vice captain to direct squad 8, especially when there are several easily capable candidates that could fill those positions (Love for Captain, Lisa or Hiyori for Vice-Captain.) I just find it questionable that Kyoraku has left his previous division so defenseless. Thoughts on this?

So I have a decent gaming laptop, It could run Dayz on great settings and everything, but the only thing holding me back is my video card for almost every game, everything else is always right on what I need or even more then what I need. I'm trying to not be a peasant anymore. Is it possible to change your video card safely in a laptop? If so, does it have to be a specific model? As a peasant I'm very uneducated. Also, for the masterminds out there, I have about $150-200 to spend on a video card, what do you recommend?",10,"[""Most of the smaller laptops can't be upgraded""]",[[]],[[]],"{'claim': [""Most of the smaller laptops can't be upgraded""], 'ground': [[]]}"
