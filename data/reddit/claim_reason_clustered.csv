So before I go and submit an issue on github suggesting this, is there anything I'm missing? Is this use case already handled somehow?

reddit,28,"C2 Kodi Media Centre   Hi there,      It's time for me to retire my old RPi B+.  It's been a great trip, but it's years old and now I think it's time to upgrade.  I've been doing a little research and came across the ODROID hardware.  It's selling point to me was the HEVC GPU support - something the RPi3 lacks currently.      It seems that the C1's are fairly well supported with OpenELEC, but I'm having trouble finding some concrete answers about the C2 and it's software compatibility.      Coming from the world of RPi, I've had life really easy - with custom distro's like RaspBMC/OSMC that are super easy to use, and work out of the box.  I'm hoping that OpenELEC is as easy (I used it once, in the early days but it's performance wasn't comparable).      I'm hoping that someone here, with ODOIRD experience can alleviate my concerns so I can go ahead and buy this beauty..      * HEVC Support?  Is it really hardware HEVC support in the GPU?  Happy with 1080p HEVC@30p, which is currently the same performance I get from the RPi1 with x264.  Can this be confirmed?   * OS and Kodi support?  As said earlier, OpenELEC looks like they support the C1's - do they also support the C2's yet?  Otherwise, is there a better option?  CentOS or Debian ""headless""?  I'm pretty comfortable with Linux so no issues if I have to DIY it a bit.  Just want to know the best software options, provided this will be at a TV with no kb/mouse - just a remote.   * HDMI CEC support?  Currently have this with OSMC/RPi so that I can use the remote that came with the TV for everything.   * HDMI audio passthrough (?) - not sure if this is right, but I'm assuming the C2 will send audio over HDMI?      Thanks guys.

As a community of vapers that has really helped to get the word out regarding our product I felt that you all deserved an explanation for why we have decided to start charging more. There are two primary reasons. When this company started out I was the only employee and for the last six months it has just been my brother and I filling every order that has come in. We have grown to the point where we need to begin bringing on additional help, which surprisingly enough does not come for free.

reddit,220,"Proud of the Wife's Decision   So I've been shopping for my wife her first handgun for about 2 weeks now. I've looked at everything from Glocks to Rugers to Smith & Wessons. Literally everything that I could find that I thought she'd like.       We have been discussing what caliber she wants and she was back and forth from everything from .22 which would have just been for the range up to 9mm. So we go to the shop this evening and she starts looking around. I thought she was looking at a Glock and a Taurus 9mm. When she starts zeroing in on the 1911. Once she held it she said it was the one for her. So I bought it for her. She has shot a friends .45 before and could handle the gun/recoil. But it was a lot more gun than she had been talking about. For the whole ride home she couldn't understand why I was surprised she went with the .45. She'll get out this weekend to shoot it, but I'm sure she'll love it.       What I think I'm most proud of is I showed her how to break it down and reassemble it one time, and she was able to do it herself the next time on her own.       So I just wanted to share with Gunnit.  I know it's not the fanciest 1911 out there, but it's hers and she seems pretty happy with it. I'm glad I've been able to get her into shooting though, but now my trips to the range are twice as expensive!",3,[['It came apart no problem']]

reddit,227,"Negatives with weight   So I got this crazy idea while reading all the talk on benefits of eccentric exercises. I've hit somewhat of a stale period in workout growth and I'm looking to incorporate something new into my routine. I'm basically planning on pretending that I'm hugely overweight by adding on a weight vest of 90 pounds. I doubt I'll be able to do any pull ups or push ups with it on but I intend to focus heavily on negatives until I can achieve full ROM reps. My stats below         Weight: 190      Height: 5' 6      Age: 28      Max pullups (full ROM, no weight): 11      Max pushups (full ROM, no weight): 40         Anyways, I wanted to get everyone's thoughts on the subject. Also, if someone could answer the following before I start, I would greatly appreciate it.          What are the negative (heh...) consequences to doing a program like this? (higher risk of injury, unbalanced workouts, etc)      Are there any obvious benefits/drawbacks to training like this as opposed to traditional set/reps programs? (X% of max reps for Y sets, 6-12 for strength gains, etc)?          Before people start with the nay saying, I want to point out that I'm not suggesting or advocating this program over traditional body weight programs. Nor am I saying this is better/worse than other programs. This is more of an experiment on new methods of training.
