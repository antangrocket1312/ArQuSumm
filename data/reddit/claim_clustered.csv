reddit,17,"A way to initialize an array to useful values   I'm unaware of any way, in Rust, to initialize an array directly to useful values (without using unsafe code).

Once to 0s, and again to the useful values.

reddit,28,"C2 Kodi Media Centre   Hi there,      It's time for me to retire my old RPi B+.  It's been a great trip, but it's years old and now I think it's time to upgrade.  I've been doing a little research and came across the ODROID hardware.  It's selling point to me was the HEVC GPU support - something the RPi3 lacks currently.      It seems that the C1's are fairly well supported with OpenELEC, but I'm having trouble finding some concrete answers about the C2 and it's software compatibility.      Coming from the world of RPi, I've had life really easy - with custom distro's like RaspBMC/OSMC that are super easy to use, and work out of the box.  I'm hoping that OpenELEC is as easy (I used it once, in the early days but it's performance wasn't comparable).      I'm hoping that someone here, with ODOIRD experience can alleviate my concerns so I can go ahead and buy this beauty..      * HEVC Support?  Is it really hardware HEVC support in the GPU?  Happy with 1080p HEVC@30p, which is currently the same performance I get from the RPi1 with x264.  Can this be confirmed?   * OS and Kodi support?  As said earlier, OpenELEC looks like they support the C1's - do they also support the C2's yet?  Otherwise, is there a better option?  CentOS or Debian ""headless""?  I'm pretty comfortable with Linux so no issues if I have to DIY it a bit.  Just want to know the best software options, provided this will be at a TV with no kb/mouse - just a remote.   * HDMI CEC support?  Currently have this with OSMC/RPi so that I can use the remote that came with the TV for everything.   * HDMI audio passthrough (?) - not sure if this is right, but I'm assuming the C2 will send audio over HDMI?

Octopus Vapors will be raising its prices to $15.00 a 30ml bottle. However, we will begin offering free shipping on orders for two or more bottles.      As a community of vapers that has really helped to get the word out regarding our product I felt that you all deserved an explanation for why we have decided to start charging more. There are two primary reasons. When this company started out I was the only employee and for the last six months it has just been my brother and I filling every order that has come in. We have grown to the point where we need to begin bringing on additional help, which surprisingly enough does not come for free. The second primary reason that we are raising the prices is to help us get out ahead of the looming FDA regulations.      I know that there will be many of you who are frustrated with our company and our brand for raising the prices. Believe me this was not an easy decision to make. I've been mulling over this for about three months.      Our prices have always been more than reasonable, and we believe that even by raising our prices we still fall within the range of reasonable. I personally believe that the quality of juice that you receive along with our customer service is worth what we'll soon be charging. However, what I think and what is reality are often two different things.      Thank you all for helping my company grow and for the passionate following the we've received.

reddit,227,"Negatives with weight   So I got this crazy idea while reading all the talk on benefits of eccentric exercises. I've hit somewhat of a stale period in workout growth and I'm looking to incorporate something new into my routine. I'm basically planning on pretending that I'm hugely overweight by adding on a weight vest of 90 pounds.

Also, if someone could answer the following before I start, I would greatly appreciate it.          What are the negative (heh...) consequences to doing a program like this? (higher risk of injury, unbalanced workouts, etc)      Are there any obvious benefits/drawbacks to training like this as opposed to traditional set/reps programs? (X% of max reps for Y sets, 6-12 for strength gains, etc)?

So I have a decent gaming laptop, It could run Dayz on great settings and everything, but the only thing holding me back is my video card for almost every game, everything else is always right on what I need or even more then what I need. I'm trying to not be a peasant anymore. Is it possible to change your video card safely in a laptop? If so, does it have to be a specific model? As a peasant I'm very uneducated.
