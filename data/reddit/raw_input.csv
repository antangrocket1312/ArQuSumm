Bike racks - what to look for?   I'm in the market for a bike rack. I've been looking at the Saris Bones 2 and 3. The only difference I can tell between the them is that the 3 series has an extra arm for stability. Is the Bones 2 not to be trusted?      Any other brands/models I should be considering?,"[""Strangely enough, I have both the Bones 2 and the Bones 3 so I can compare them.      To me, the 2 is preferable for regular use because the 3 is just too large and awkward to handle if you'll be installing and removing it often. The 3 is very bulky. I only use the 3 when I need to carry 3 bikes (or 2 mountain bikes so they have more room since they are so bulky).      One problem I've experienced with the Saris racks is that it's hard to get the straps to stay tight so there is always a little slack that makes me nervous. Though I've never had bikes fall off, I did once hit a big bump while carrying 3 bikes and the straps got noticeably looser and sagged down, which freaked me out and caused me to pull over on the highway to retighten the straps.      Also, the Saris has 6 straps (2 for the top of the trunk, 2 for the sides, and 2 for the bottom). I think the side straps are unnecessary. Installing it takes longer due to the number of straps to lash down.      Before this, I used an inexpensive one made by Allen, which I sold because I thought Saris was an upgrade. But actually I think the cheap Allen one was better in some ways. The straps never came loose for me, there are only 4 straps (not 6 as with Saris), and it was small compared to the bulky Saris racks.      But one advantage of the Saris racks is that the carrying arms are adjustable so that you can bring them closer together for smaller frame bikes."", ""Have a hitch?  Consider the Thelma from Saris, Thule's 916/917, or Yakima HoldUp.  These don't contact the frame, preventing paint damage and potentially frame damage from some of the racks that clamp the top tubes (people like to over-tighten these on carbon bikes and crack the tubes).      If not, I'd stick with the Bones, either one will work fine and they have a very good reputation."", ""I agree.  If you have a hitch, it's great.  We have a Yakima HoldUp and it's awesome.  We also have Swingdaddy for when we have more than 2 bikes."", ""even saris says 'if you can attach bikes to a roof rack or a hitch, do that' if no use the bones      I bought a bones and rarely use it... maybe i will do more in summer.       I keep thinking I should set up a website called 'borrow my...' and people can put things like that on it, also my workstand or even my mountain bike, you only need them once a month max. but they are bit cash to own."", ""The saris 2 can only take two bikes securely, I have the bones 3 and is the best bike rack i've ever had, until I got roof mounts. I use them in combination now, and usually travel to stage races with 6 (three on the roof, three on the bones) bikes and 4/5 riders in the car. It's amazing when you realize the stuff on your car is worth way more than the actual car"", ""I've had both racks and apart from one holding two bike and the other three, there's no real difference.  Personally, I prefer roof top carriers."", ""If you don't have a hitch, and have no interest of adding one, go with the Bones. I would recommend getting a hitch installed. Most of the time it can be done under $100, allows you to get a sturdier car rack at a better price point and gives you the option to tow stuff in the future. Not a bad investment. Like nexusheli above me said, the Saris Thelma is great."", ""I've got the bones 3 and absolutely love it. It fit nicely on my station wagon & now on a sedan. It keeps the bikes apart from one another. I've found that a knot with the excess cord is key to keeping it tightened. Also, it doesn't mark up the car."", ""I've had a Saris Bones 3 for the past five years, and I would highly recommend it.       Something nobody else has touched on is their service. Saris has, by far, the best customer service I've ever experienced. When my car was rear ended and one of the arms of my rack was damaged, Saris sent me two replacement arms when I explained the situation and asked where to buy another arm. I bought the rack from a friend, so I didn't have any proof of purchase, but they said it wasn't a problem. Then, when one of the straps started fraying from years of use, they sent me a whole new set for free. Truly phenomenal service."", 'I had a Saris Bones 2 for a long time. Then I got a bike stolen off of it, and quickly made the decision to buy a roof rack. Simple fact of the matter is even if I had a lock on the Bones, it would have been defeated fairly easily. Most Thule (and other racks) have integrated locking systems. I highly suggest looking into a more permanent/secure solution, as it might save your bike one day.', ""Both work well - I'm a big fan of extra stability so I prefer the 3.  For trunk racks I don't think you can do better than Saris.  If you *must* have something for comparison, the Thule trunk offering is pretty fancy and stable as well."", ""Buy a Jeep and get [one of these](http://i.imgur.com/5V11u.jpg) Thule spare tire racks.

"Crediting waitressing as a workout? Am I really starving?   Hey loseit,      I work on weekends part time as a waitress. I've been using MyFitnessPal to track calories and every time I put in a shift at work as a workout (it really is) it comes up as a huge calorie deficit. Would this actually be starvation? I don't feel starved, I'm usually very satisfied with how much I've eaten in a day on the weekend.

You're asking if you are starving because of numbers that a calculator told you.      Starvation is a physiological reaction, your body will tell you if you are starving; you do not need a calculator to tell you.      If you feel fine, the 1000kcal deficit is completely fine."", ""Hmm. I don't know... While I respect silverhydra's opinion quite a bit, I have inadvertantly gone through long periods of undereating, and was just never hungry. One day I counted only to see if I was getting enough calcium, and guess what? I was only eating 1000 calories a day on average! Obviously if I had kept that up I would have found out sooner or later, but I can say that there are people who can undereat significantly for weeks and not know."", ""I was speaking in regards to calories. In retrospect this wasn't clear on my end.      If calories are too low, they will signal hormones and other compounds in the body to increase hunger (in most cases, eating disorders avoid this), if you are undereating by 1000kcal a day, you may very well be getting  those extra calories from body fat and glycogen. (1000kcal less intake, but 300kcal taken from glycogen and 700kcal taken from fat makes you even out).

It came up to average about 7.2 miles assuming its a busy restaurant with 6.5 hour shifts.', 'Personally, after a lot of experience trying to predict my weight loss by the numbers (and always failing miserably), I think it\'s more helpful to think of your activity level in a more general way. Waitressing *is* a workout, and I think you\'re completely justified in regarding it as one. But rather than trying to quantify it in terms of ""I burn this many calories during a shift"", you might try thinking of it as more of a running average over the course of a week. Losing fat is all about averages, and the only purpose to calculating day-to-day estimates is to help maintain those averages.       So you might think of it more as, ""because I have an active job, and because in addition I work out X times per week, my typical average calorie requirements for maintenance are 2500 per day."" Or whatever, plug in your own numbers. Then change your diet in response to that figure, run with it for a month, and then measure your results against what you expected to see. Over a few months you\'ll get a pretty good idea of how many calories you actually burn in a given day.', 'I wouldn\'t put too much faith in workout calorie burning estimations.  I suspect they count that time\'s worth of your basal metabolic rate (BMR) (i.e., assuming your BMR is 1200 calories and you waitress 8 hours, 400 calories of what they tell you, you\'d still be burning if you were laying in bed).  For evidence of that, I just looked up ""calories burned watching TV"" and was told 68 calories/hour; 58 calories/hour is my BMR.  So... if you add in 8 hours of your activities PLUS your BMR you can way overestimate how much you burn.

If I build a house, I\'ll probably put five-six drops in each room....  one per wall, and one near the light switch for the inevitable ""control module"" or phone. with the option of one where I\'d expect to wall-mount a TV.

Of course in that case it\'s a good argument for the use of iterators over literal ranges but it would be nice to get an error there. I guess one solution would be to make the unitilialized value checker a bit more clever and make it understand that you can fully initialize an array if you initialize all its elements, but it might be complicated to implement.', ""Neat! I like that it's similar to the already-existing [`Vec::from_fn`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/collections/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.from_fn), which does basically the same thing.

Piazon - Not much to say that wasn't already apparent during his time with us, only difference is he is now been given the chance of first team football. Were it up to me he would have gotten all those games Moses did for us and would probably be better off by now.      PVA - Seems to have improved defensively over the years, going forward has never been the issue with PVA as he's always been a pretty good dribbler for a fullback. Crossing is a bit poor but still better than Cole's. I don't think he will ever be first choice but will make a solid backup to Bertrand.       Then there's others like Josh, Chalobah, Romeu (if he's over his injury), Hazard, Lukaku, etc.       Talent is there, just depends on if the club are willing to take the risk.

"C2 Kodi Media Centre   Hi there,      It's time for me to retire my old RPi B+.  It's been a great trip, but it's years old and now I think it's time to upgrade.  I've been doing a little research and came across the ODROID hardware.  It's selling point to me was the HEVC GPU support - something the RPi3 lacks currently.      It seems that the C1's are fairly well supported with OpenELEC, but I'm having trouble finding some concrete answers about the C2 and it's software compatibility.      Coming from the world of RPi, I've had life really easy - with custom distro's like RaspBMC/OSMC that are super easy to use, and work out of the box.  I'm hoping that OpenELEC is as easy (I used it once, in the early days but it's performance wasn't comparable).      I'm hoping that someone here, with ODOIRD experience can alleviate my concerns so I can go ahead and buy this beauty..      * HEVC Support?  Is it really hardware HEVC support in the GPU?  Happy with 1080p HEVC@30p, which is currently the same performance I get from the RPi1 with x264.  Can this be confirmed?   * OS and Kodi support?

Just want to know the best software options, provided this will be at a TV with no kb/mouse - just a remote.   * HDMI CEC support?

Could even be a heat issue?  I haven't looked into it.      One other thing is that I had to use a looong delay on Kodi.

From fresh boot, even with the Kodi start-up delay of 20s, 80% of the time it will boot up without finding the library DB and I reboot it via the GUI and it comes back fine.

However, I do still reward her 95+% of the time she does it (either with a treat, or by picking her up so she doesn't have to fly back), since I've only had her 6 months I want it to be really solid before I start fading out rewards too much."", 'My grey (who isn\'t trained), loves saying ""Poop"".

I think the key is really getting to know your specific bird, they are all a little different. Mine gets wiggly and fidgets around, or she ruffles her tailfeathers a certain way. Try to watch for a change in how they are interacting with you. If you see them about to poop, sometimes you can GENTLY blow in their face and take them to the pooping place quickly. I wouldn't start with that though. Start by bringing them to their perch or playstand about every 15 minutes but no longer. When he or she poops, give lots of love and praise or a treat. If they do poop on you, immediately bring them to the perch or playstand. The idea is to reward them with positive reinforcement rather than just the negative. It does take some time depending on your bird. I have found most birds are pretty easy to train. Even now I make it a habit to get up off the couch once an a while to see if she has to go.

Combine that with the fact that you can't get full cover blocks and if you are willing to WC it would be better to get reference cards and OC the hell out of them (in a case that can support WCing, I can't see anywhere on that case to mount a rad, except maybe a very thin 120 at the back, which isn't enough to do anything)"", ""I'm actually looking at the 3GB Vapor-X, not the 6GB.    the Sapphire card is a little more expensive, but reviews seem to universally be impressed by the quality.      the ability to add the second GPU is kind of my thought towards future upgrades. I'm bouncing back and forth on it...i just really don't have room for a big ATX tower."", ""Oh right, you linked to the 6GB card on coolingconfig so thought you had looked up block compatibility of the card and posted an image link.      If you only need a single card then I would look at the Bitfenix Prodigy, iTX case than can fit enough stuff in there to WC a CPU+GPU (can't fit dual GPU unless you get dual GPU card) or just aircool them if you aren't that bothered.      If you still want room for a second card then I'll look into different cases, the one you linked isn't good for watercooling, and maybe different cards so you can fit full cover blocks (pretty much any reference design GHz card will OC just as well on water). If you really want that case (or one as compact) then you need to change GPUs to ones that can fit in a close dual GPU setup, there's no other way."", ""gotcha, thanks.      it seems like Mini-ITX or Micro-ATX won't make much of a difference here."", ""Not sure how well a 2.5 slot card will fit into a Prodigy (or potential other iTX cases), although there are plenty of equally as good 2 slot cooler designs so in the end it shouldn't matter.

The angle and the fact that the 6GB is slightly thicker throws it off a bit, there *should* be room in the Prodigy for the Vapor-X 3GB but I can't be 100%"", ""Sure it's possible, but the constrained space of a mATX case will present great difficulty.      If you chose water cooling, you also have to fit the pump, a res (or T line), the radiator, and all the hosing to connect all that.

It goes from extremely basic non-music to mind bogglingly confusing. Any help will be greatly appreciated!","['I\'ve been playing clawhammer banjo for like 40+ years (a frightening thought!) and I honestly could not learn a tune from that video.      Not saying it\'s a bad video, just that my brain doesn\'t learn that way. For starters, banjo is first a *rhythm* instrument. One can play very melodically but the foundation is the rhythm not the melody. When I get super fancy (for me) - lots up the neck etc I\'m still basically playing a rhythmic pattern and the notes are supporting the rhythm not the other way around. It wasn\'t until I started fiddle a few years ago that I realized that the actual notes matter -  because on the fiddle they do (a lot) but on the banjo they don\'t so much.      So if I were learning this, I\'d find a sample or teacher that started with a super-simple rhythm. Bum ditty is fine. Just play simple chords, just close enough to sing along. Add one or two - no more - melody notes here and there. Then, play the crap out of it until it\'s second nature. Then, add one or two more melody notes, and play the crap out if that for a while.       For me, ""a while"" usually means days, weeks even months - for others more talented an hour or two should suffice.       The idea is that it should be enjoyable - it should *feel* like you\'re playing the song, instead of feeling like a science project.', ""I'm not sure if I'm understanding correctly. But I've always had a hard time learning from videos. I really find playing from tab to be the best way to learn a song. Check out mike inverson's clawhammer tab website. There are tons of great beginning songs on there.      Edit: here is the link      http://www.bluesageband.com/Tabs.html"", ""Clawhammer does have a rhythm portion, but it's much more melodic than 2 finger (which it sounds like you're coming from).   Focus on playing the melodies first.  The ornamental notes in between can come much later.  You're not doing rolls, but playing a song with notes in order.  It's okay to have full quarter notes, skip the ditty and just hold for the melody.  You don't need to keep pounding on the bum ditty if it doesn't fit the song.  Strip it down, play the melody, and only add in the extra notes when needed.  This is where good tab helps... it helps see where people are adding and subtracting."", ""Haha my advice was almost the opposite - start with the rhythm. But I think in a way it's the same advice, just from different directions!"", ""I guess I come from a piano background, so the idea of melody first, rhythm and additions later probably starts from there.  I know I was frustrated when I started learning through rhythm only how few songs sounded like songs.  It's far easier for me to keep up playing if it sounded more and more like the song.  That being said, I had already a pretty good ability to understand complex note patterns and such from piano while keep time.  Who knows, that was my experience at least."", 'Looking over your suggestion, I can see where it\'s the same: you suggest stripping out all the \'fluff\' - just get the shell of the melody rather than try to force it into an arbitrary rhythmic pattern. Otherwise it\'s just confusing (as the OP discovered).      Really both are the same: get the feel of actually *playing* the tune - it doesn\'t matter if you start with some rhythmic pattern and slowly add melody, or start with melody and add rhythm later. The real music comes from having fun and feeling like you\'re *playing* - and either approach will get you there.      To me, banjo has this magical third dimension, where the melody IS the rhythm. A strongly played melody - no brushes or ""bum ditty"" at all - can still sound amazingly rhythmic and deliver a great pulse or ""tick tock"" too. But it takes a while playing to get to that point - and the way to get there is to *play*.', 'Try to use your ears more. Dont watch someone explain it. Find a version of the song you like, and just listen to it a lot.       The bum is going to be your melody note. The ditty is going to be the ""strum/thumb"". In some spots in this song, you play a few melody notes without bum dittying.', 'This simple explanation is so helpful. Thanks!', 'Actually no wait - my confusion is this: I end up ""uneven"" On the bum ditty. After a few melody strikes in a row, do I always ""dit-ty""? I feel like I end up in a weird place off rhythm in the measure trying to fit in a strum and thumb, so would I ever just strum or just thumb, but not both?       It usually happens when I feel I need to strike another melody note before the next two ("" dit-ty"") beats.', 'Yes you can ""rest"" for the bum and then just ditty. Or just hit a few melody notes and then jump back into the entire bum ditty.    That may actually just confuse you more. Man! I wish I could just show you. I dont have anything to record video with. This is actually a really good song to practice this stuff.       So can you play the beginning? ( 2nd string- ditty, 3rd string-ditty, 4th string-ditty, 3rd string-ditty)      After that I play a few notes of melody. (2nd string, 3rdstring/2nd fret, 2nd string, 2ndstring/first fret, 2nd string-ditty, 3rd string ditty. Then you would grab the C chord.       Shit I feel like I may just be confusing you more.', 'Nah man you good. Thanks much.       I grew up playing piano for over a decade but there was never any emphasis on improvisation, obviously.

They were sent as a normal Dogecoin blockchain to the tipbot service, who held them and re-allocated them (within their own internal records) over to the recipient when the Tip instruction was sent.      Then, D4W sent a Withdraw type instruction, causing the tipbot to do a Dogecoin Blockchain transaction of the requested amount out to their nominated Dogecoin address.

"Project CARS Vs Assetto Corsa. Which one should I purchase?   After a long time not touching the genre (Need For Speed: Most Wanted is the last one I remember playing for a serious amount of time, the 2005 one featuring the BMW that is), I recently picked up GT5 again and have been having a blast.

From my perspective PCars is more arcade than AC.The driving is a bit more arcade than gran turismo. The force feedback is bad (about the same as GT), cars are too easy to drive, crashing into other cars has nearly no effect (most of the time the cars just drive straight on after a collision). It looks nice and it's fun to race.     AC on the other hand has a much much better force feedback, the cars are harder (and more realistic) to drive than PCars. It also has a very good mod support: You can already download hundreds of cars and tracks for it.     TL;DR: PCars is an arcade game like Gran Turismo or Forza.

There isn't much of a career mode in AC, just a list of preset time attacks, time trials, and short races. What it is great for is lapping a fantastically detailed track, in a fantastically detailed car, with fantastically detailed force feedback. I haven't spent much time in online races because I haven't had a good experience, lots of lag and public rooms are terrible. Kunos comes out with updates fairly regularly, so that's a plus.

I played PCARS over the last few days and despite it being the release version I didn't like it at all, the force feedback is weak and confusing, the cars handle in an arcade fashion that doesn't really match up to the force feedback. For example, I'll spin and have no real idea why.      AC is much better, the Force feedback is the best I've ever felt in a racing sim, far better than iRacing which WAS the best up until now.      Everything feels right and intuitive, every time I spin I know why and what i did wrong, its defiantly the best sim out there.

"Whit E. Octopus Vapors Announces a Raise in Prices   Dear fellow vapers, regretfully I must announce that on Friday January 2, 2015 Whit E. Octopus Vapors will be raising its prices to $15.00 a 30ml bottle. However, we will begin offering free shipping on orders for two or more bottles.      As a community of vapers that has really helped to get the word out regarding our product I felt that you all deserved an explanation for why we have decided to start charging more. There are two primary reasons. When this company started out I was the only employee and for the last six months it has just been my brother and I filling every order that has come in. We have grown to the point where we need to begin bringing on additional help, which surprisingly enough does not come for free. The second primary reason that we are raising the prices is to help us get out ahead of the looming FDA regulations.      I know that there will be many of you who are frustrated with our company and our brand for raising the prices. Believe me this was not an easy decision to make. I've been mulling over this for about three months.      Our prices have always been more than reasonable, and we believe that even by raising our prices we still fall within the range of reasonable. I personally believe that the quality of juice that you receive along with our customer service is worth what we'll soon be charging. However, what I think and what is reality are often two different things.      Thank you all for helping my company grow and for the passionate following the we've received.

"Is this a realistic blackjack strategy   hi, sounds lame but I've been playing a bit of blackjack at home with my girlfriend and online(not for money) and have come up with a strategy that seems to work pretty well.      Firstly most casinos use a dealer must hit on 16/stand on 17 system.    My strategy takes advantage of that.       Play normally and hit on sixteen and stand on seventeen only betting about 1% of my bankroll at a time. Splitting when possible unless it is a 20 or two aces. Then after I have lost three goes in a row place a much larger bet on the fourth, ie 30%, if this fails then go all in on the fifth round since my first loss. It usually take a bit of back and forth to get the three losses in a row but is very effective once you do.      Is this a strategy already in use?   Does this count as card-counting?   Will this actually work in a casino?      Finally using some of the statistics knowledge I learnt at uni!","[""This won't work, unfortunately. You're using a modified martingale strategy which means that it's only a matter of time before you come to a big losing streak. It's not rare to lose 90%+ (it's not common, but it happens) of all hands in a 6 deck shoe. If you really want to devote time to blackjack, read up on card counting and some books on the statistics of blackjack.       You said you'll bet 1% at minimum, you can easily lose 100 units in a weekend. Betting 30% after losing 3 in a row only affords you 3 chances to lose. You'll be done in an hour.

I'm probably not going to end up at the casino because I don't really like gambling I was more interested in the strategy!"", ""Just as a tip, I advise against splitting wherever possible other than 20s. You want to get as much money in the hand as possible when it's an advantage to you. If you're up against anything higher than a six, you don't want to be splitting sixes and fours. Never split 5's.       The only true BJ strategy other than counting, is to manage a bankroll, play basic strategy and not hunches, and don't bet what you can't afford to lose. Maybe in the short term you'll have some winning sessions, especially if you bet bigger if you notice the deck has been devoid of face cards and hit big on some 20s and blackjacks. Over time, everyone loses sans counting.      With your strategy, you would go dead broke because it is possible to lose more than 5 hands of blackjack in a row.      Edit: My phrasing on the first sentence was wrong, I don't advise against splitting anywhere and endorse splitting 20s."", ""Ok   With regard to losing a certain amount in a row, I was basing it off basic statistics, in one hand it's basically fifty fifty whether you win or lose and that to lose twice in a row is 25% then 12.5% and so on and what I'm basically betting on as it goes along is the chance of t being in that 93.75% (1- 6.25%).

Thanks!","['I don\'t know much about either of the speakers, but my initial hunch is that you\'ll likely get a bit more low-end out of the Bic Americas since they have a larger woofer (2+2 per speaker, at that). I\'d be concerned about the lack of focus in the mid-range though, since there\'s no 3-5"" driver.', ""I'm currently used to listening through everything through either TV speakers or some Bose computer speakers (parents christmas gift years ago)....hoping that those would at least be a step up. And louder. Again, not an audiophile."", 'within reason, any set of floor standing speakers will sound much better than tv speakers or bose computer speakers. larger cabinets provide more room for reverberation of sound and a bunch of other technical things, so you automatically have the benefit just by having the larger cabinets. that\'s why smaller computer speakers and home theater in a box systems sound ""tinny"". Either set of those you listed would sound fine to you, I\'m sure, but MY initial instinct was to go with the Bic Americas. Pioneer makes some decent receivers and such on the high end, but I\'m sort of ""meh"" toward their speakers.       I highly recommend going to an audio store around you if you can, just to get a listen on some of the different things they have to offer, even if you end up buying online.

You can add a subwoofer as a next thing to save up for.', ""I've not heard the Bic's, but I have the Pioneers. They are good for the money, but are somewhat lacking in low end and are not very efficient, meaning that they produce less sound per watt than higher end speakers. At higher volumes they sound pretty good, but the low end doesn't fill in until the speakers start getting more power.      Good for the money, but if you later add a powered sub and higher efficiency surrounds, you might run the risk of drowning out the fronts or having to underpower the surrounds/sub to compensate.      But the Bics might have the same problem, so take my advice with a grain of salt."", ""If I was on a budget at that level, I'd go for the Pioneer Andrew Jones speakers.

"ELI5 - Tax deferred dividends   Hey,      So basically I bought some shares via CommSec and I am soon to receive a Tax Deferred Dividend.      I truly have no idea what that means. Could someone explain what the tax deferred bit means?      Do I need to do something with the ATO.      Hoping AusLaw includes tax law.      Thanks in advanced!","['Ok, so I think you may be confusing ""dividend"" with ""distribution"" - I won\'t go into the detail explaining the difference.      However, a tax deferred distribution is just how it sounds - you receive an amount of money which you don\'t pay tax on now, you pay tax on it later.      A distribution can be fully tax deferred, or partially tax deferred - this just refers to the components making up the distribution, or the amount of money you have received.      This is also the case if you have your shares (or, in my assumption) stapled securities, on a dividend/distribution reinvestment plan - where you receive additional shares instead of a cash payment.      So, tax deferred - you pay tax on it later. But when? Well, what happens is that any tax deferred distribution you receive reduces your cost base for capital gains tax purposes. Thus you effectively pay tax later, by having a higher capital gain when you sell the securities.      By way of example:   You bought 5 000 securities at $1.00 = $5000.00 + $29.95 brokerage to ComSec. So, your total cost and your cost base for CGT purposes would be $5029.95      Then, you receive a tax deferred distribution of say $500.00      Your cost base after the distribution is now $4529.95.      You\'ve physically received $500, but don\'t have to pay income tax on it in the financial year when you received it. Instead, your CGT cost base is reduced, and therefore you will ""pay more tax"" when you sell the investment at a later point in time.       Clear as mud?', ""Spot on.      Source: I'm a tax accountant"", 'I think I get it.      So hypothetically if I buy my shares this year, and using $50,000 as my income figure in very simple terms using your example:      +$50,000 - Earnings   -$5,029.95 - initial investment plus brokerage   +$500 - Dividend   Taxable income = $45,029.95      Is that correct? Or am I completely wrong..?      I know I will have to head to an accountant for my tax I would just like to know how things work before I get there.      Thanks for your help.', 'Incorrect.      When you purchase shares or units as an investor you hold then on capital account. That means that you do not get a tax deduction for the initial outlay. You only get the benefit of the initial outlay (I.e. The cost base) when you eventual dispose of the asset. When you dispose of an investment you reduce the capital proceeds (ie the sale price multiplied by the number sold less brokerage) by the cost base (ie the purchase price multiplied by the number bought plus brokerage). Where there is a gain (ie proceeds > cost base) you will include the gain as taxable income. If you hold the asset for more than 12 months you may be able to reduce the taxable amount by 50% if you were an Australian tax resident for the entire holding period. If you make a capital loss on the sale, then the loss is carried forward and can only be used to offset future capital gains. You cannot offset capital losses against taxable income.      In the scenario that you provided, if someone earned $50k from their job, purchased stables securities worth $5k (including brokerage) and received at $500 100% tax deferred distribution from said stapled securities (all in the same tax year) them taxable income will still be $50k,      Naturally there are many factors and tax laws that need to be taken into consideration and I do not know your exact situation. As such you may not rely on the information that I have provided and should seek independent advice from a qualified professional.      Edit:      Info on cgt from ATO website http://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investing/In-detail/Disposing-of-assets/Guide-to-capital-gains-tax-2012-13/      Info on tax deferred distributions from ATO website http://www.ato.gov.au/General/Capital-gains-tax/In-detail/Trusts/Non-assessable-capital-payments-from-a-trust/?page=3      The ATO has a lot of info that has been simplified for non-professionals. 10/10 would recommend.', ""Spot on.

In short you don't need to do anything with the ATO till you expirence a CGT event (I gather, like I said, this is pretty foreign)       Shares 101: Dividends contribute to your taxable income, and things get a little funky with franking credits but basically they get taxed at your marginal rate.      That deferred part isn't taxed instead it you take it away from the sale price when you have a CGT event. This has large implications for larger holdings over a long period of time.

idol of pestilence   my friend thought this card was overpowered or broken because you can plunk it down in the corner and it ends up doing a lot of damage by the end of the game it survived 4 rounds and ended up doing 16 damage spread out. plus if your the necromancer it doesn't hurt you at all or your creatures. if you do try to take it out you have to spend alot of time and go out of your way to kill it . what you you guys think ?,"[""A lot of the conjurations are super overpowered.

Most people have traditional 401ks, so they contribute a certain percent of their pay to their 401k investment account, and that comes out of their paycheck, with no income taxes deducted.

When you depreciate an asset as an expense, it also decreases shareholder equity. The combination of these two things is the reason why many profitable companies have a negative shareholder equity.

"PADI Junior Open Water Certification to PADI Open Water?   Hello everyone,   I haven't gone scuba diving in many years (since by time in Boy Scouts) and have been motivated to get back into it as I am going to Iceland this September.       I would like to go scuba diving in Silfra gully: the dive between two tectonic plates. The dive tour company there states I will need a open water certification along with experience with a dry suit.      My question is what steps I will need to take to get up to speed for the upcoming dive. Does a Jr Open Water certification automatically becomes an Open Water when I turned 18? If not, is there some sort of standard transition course that my local dive shop would have? Is there a special certification for the dry suit component?       Appreciate the help!","[""Since you haven't done it in years I would simply suggest doing your open water class.  It's a good way to refresh your skills and learn anything you may not have gotten the first time around. You'll also want to do the drysuit specialty.

If it's been that long, I would recommend retaking the course. You'll feel confident diving again and will actually be able to enjoy the dive. If you cannot do that, there are SCUBA refresher programs that can be done.

Any ideas on what to start them on? resources? curricula?       Thanks in advance!","[""I'm speaking as a jazz / improvisation teacher, so I am biased, but I think the best thing you could do is help them find a more specialized teacher.      I've had a few students who have come from teachers who focus on beginner/intermediate players who have attempted to teach them jazz.  The students come away with knowledge of the blues scale and a few vanilla-sounding root-position voicings.  We generally have to start over at the beginning.      Things in the classical world can be easier to teach because you're usually dealing with a set piece of music with very rigid rules.  There are still rules in jazz, but they are much more flexible and the amount of freedom can be overwhelming for student and teacher if they are unprepared.      Anyway, that's just my two cents.  I feel that knowing your limitations as a teacher will make you a better teacher in the long run."", 'As another jazz educator, I completely agree with this.

If they can recognize chord tones vs non-chord tones and extended harmony 9ths 11ths 13ths etc..      Maybe introduce song form AAB, AABA; point them to some jazz to listen to in order to hear the difference. Possibly even find an arrangement that is written out, but in an ""authentic jazz style"" (as much as it pains me to say that) to make sure its something they like.       Analyze it (aforementioned arrangement); chords? extentions? where is the melody? bass-line? where does the harmonic progression end, and subsequently begin again?      And most importantly, make sure they understand the importance of rhythm, not even necessarily jazz rhythms, but just basic, four beats in a measure, rhythm.      Make sure they can execute 3/4 and 4/4 without adding or dropping beats.      Learn scales. Have at least a minimal amount of facility on the piano.

Once you start getting the hang of Linear Algebra, I find Gel'fand's [Lectures on Linear Algebra](http://www.amazon.com/Lectures-Linear-Algebra-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486660826) to be an absolute beast of a book. It's not great for learning things the first time round, but when you sorta know some of the stuff already, it's a great reference since it's so concise and clearly written.

"How this Year's Draft Could Make Us a Winner in Next Year's   I was just thinking about the 3rd rounder traded to Miami for a 3rd and 4th next year (and 6 this year, damn). I just think that it makes WAY too much sense that with adding those picks we would trade up in next year's draft. What would our pressing needs be? Well, Adrian is going to be 31 then and costing us around 18 MILLION. Plus, we did not plan ahead for this year by drafting a power/replacement running back to groom.

What do you all think about this idea?","[""Fournette is probably going to be a very high pick.. so probably not him. It'll cost too much to trade up (**FROM 32**) I think.

But I don't think he will go as high as 4 but probably around the bottom half of the top 10.

Those tables don't have a column for reps, so does that mean that since I can currently do about a 14 second negative pull-up (just tested), I train by doing 3 or 4 single negatives of 9 seconds, resting between each, and that's it?      I did find that doing 3x5, by the last set I wasn't able to control the negatives so I was just dropping in much less than 5 seconds."", ""Someone correct me if I am wrong, but the table shows the required stimulus to create a 'training effect' i.e. muscle growth.

Try to increase to 10 when you can, and do 5 sets of 10 for 50 seconds. etc.  Make sure the total time falls within the specified range.      That is my understanding from the book and the public article.      **EDIT:** Ok, found [this post](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=89&hilit=eccentrics) on the EMI forums where Steven is talking about how he used eccentrics to develop a One Arm Chin.  He said 3-5 mins rest, then once you hit a total of about 30 seconds total stimulus you can start reducing rest time in between.  Once you can do all the eccentrics back to back you should be able to do the concentric movement.      BTW, buy the book, Overcoming Gravity.  It is really great for this kind of thing.

The difference is that the iPad/iPhone outlet is using Apples proprietary way to signal that the power supply can deliver 2 Amps and the Galaxy Tab S outlet is using the Samsung way. The Pi does not use either of these signaling techniques, so it does not matter which outlet you use.', 'Thank you very much.', ""What /u/markus_b said is true, but if the power supply has some logic to signal the power delivery, it's *possible* (although not certain) that it won't let you draw more than 500mA if you don't do the handshaking, in which case, *neither* would be the correct answer. Just test it before risiking fs-corruption :)"", ""This is partially true. The USB standard, in absence of any signaling or negotiation, only allows some 150mA to be drawn. For more current the device is supposed to negotiate or detect the special signals.      But in practice an USB port always allows to draw 500mA and has no provisions to limit the current to less. A device is supposed to negotiate to get the 500mA, but most devices don't. Negotiation is necessary for the recent high-power standards with 12 or 20V as the USB port has to be told to switch to these modes. They can not do that automatically because normal devices would get killed by the 12V/20V.      Signaling, as used in this power adapter is different, as it does not require the USB protocol and a corresponding micro-controller on both ends. The USB data lines are held at specific voltages with passive components (resistors) or shorted together. This can be detected by the device and it then knows that it can draw 2 Amps instead of 500mA only. This was done to allow for low-cost power adapters to be built as requiring a micro-controller would be a significant cost."", ""Do you happen to know how to indicate to an Android device that it can draw 2A? A few months ago I built my own charger using the 5V rail from a PC power supply and I found that for Apple devices the data pins have to be held at some specific voltages for 1A and 2A, but for Android I couldn't find anything. I ended up just shorting the data pins together which makes the devices use 1A, but assumed you do need a microcontroller or something more complex for 2A."", 'There may not be a simple way valid for all devices.
