To me, the 2 is preferable for regular use because the 3 is just too large and awkward to handle if you'll be installing and removing it often. The 3 is very bulky. I only use the 3 when I need to carry 3 bikes (or 2 mountain bikes so they have more room since they are so bulky).      One problem I've experienced with the Saris racks is that it's hard to get the straps to stay tight so there is always a little slack that makes me nervous. Though I've never had bikes fall off, I did once hit a big bump while carrying 3 bikes and the straps got noticeably looser and sagged down, which freaked me out and caused me to pull over on the highway to retighten the straps.      Also, the Saris has 6 straps (2 for the top of the trunk, 2 for the sides, and 2 for the bottom). I think the side straps are unnecessary. Installing it takes longer due to the number of straps to lash down.      Before this, I used an inexpensive one made by Allen, which I sold because I thought Saris was an upgrade.

I've been using MyFitnessPal to track calories and every time I put in a shift at work as a workout (it really is) it comes up as a huge calorie deficit. Would this actually be starvation? I don't feel starved, I'm usually very satisfied with how much I've eaten in a day on the weekend.      During the week I eat around 1400 calories, but on the weekends I'm 1000 calories short when I add in my waitressing. Is that okay?","Personally, after a lot of experience trying to predict my weight loss by the numbers (and always failing miserably), I think it's more helpful to think of your activity level in a more general way. Waitressing *is* a workout, and I think you're completely justified in regarding it as one. But rather than trying to quantify it in terms of ""I burn this many calories during a shift"", you might try thinking of it as more of a running average over the course of a week. Losing fat is all about averages, and the only purpose to calculating day-to-day estimates is to help maintain those averages.       So you might think of it more as, ""because I have an active job, and because in addition I work out X times per week, my typical average calorie requirements for maintenance are 2500 per day."" Or whatever, plug in your own numbers. Then change your diet in response to that figure, run with it for a month, and then measure your results against what you expected to see. Over a few months you'll get a pretty good idea of how many calories you actually burn in a given day.","Commentators generally recommend estimating caloric burn and calorie totals instead of using a calculator. One commentator says to go by hunger, but other commentators reply that the body can eat its own energy stores without feeling hungry.

Of course in that case it's a good argument for the use of iterators over literal ranges but it would be nice to get an error there. I guess one solution would be to make the unitilialized value checker a bit more clever and make it understand that you can fully initialize an array if you initialize all its elements, but it might be complicated to implement.",All commenters talk about writing code for GitHub to get the results they want.

Piazon - Not much to say that wasn't already apparent during his time with us, only difference is he is now been given the chance of first team football.

Crossing is a bit poor but still better than Cole's. I don't think he will ever be first choice but will make a solid backup to Bertrand.       Then there's others like Josh, Chalobah, Romeu (if he's over his injury), Hazard, Lukaku, etc.       Talent is there, just depends on if the club are willing to take the risk.

]","What Chelsea FC loaned players do you think could eventually come back to play for Chelsea?   Just to clarify, we have a ridiculous amount of loaned players. I was just wondering if those who follow the leagues in which loaned Chelsea players are in could shed some light onto which players they could see actually breaking into the first team rather than being continuously loaned or sold. (The easy one is Courtios, so lets discuss some of the others)","Well, he wouldn't be competing with Hazard, Schurrle and Willian - Only KDB, Mata and Oscar, and if the rumours are true, KDB will be leaving us shortly, therefore he'll be against Mata and Oscar, which would be fine.      Again, this is who I'd like to see back, maybe in a year or two - Squads change all the time, so stating he's gone forever is very short sighted.      If you wanted to pick someone from the list who has the least chance of getting back in the squad, it would be Kakuta and Moses.","Most commenters think that the players Courtios, Chalobah, and Lukaku will return to play for their team instead of staying forever loaned out. One commenter goes into detail about which players they think have what it takes to get on a team and get to stay there. Another commenter says that they forgot that their team had so many players loaned out.",19,reddit,1

I've been doing a little research and came across the ODROID hardware.  It's selling point to me was the HEVC GPU support - something the RPi3 lacks currently.      It seems that the C1's are fairly well supported with OpenELEC, but I'm having trouble finding some concrete answers about the C2 and it's software compatibility.      Coming from the world of RPi, I've had life really easy - with custom distro's like RaspBMC/OSMC that are super easy to use, and work out of the box.

Audio is sent via HDMI to my TV, and HDMI-CEC worked out of the box also.  It ticks all my boxes.      Only thing is it will occasionally freeze, in the GUI.  Maybe it's the skin, maybe it's that I am using it with an SD card, maybe it's something else.  Doesn't bother me that much, but it does bother the missus but oh well .. lol.  Could even be a heat issue?  I haven't looked into it.      One other thing is that I had to use a looong delay on Kodi.  It seems most of the time, it brings Kodi up before the network and so Kodi doesn't connect to its library, running on a MySQL server on my LAN.  From fresh boot, even with the Kodi start-up delay of 20s, 80% of the time it will boot up without finding the library DB and I reboot it via the GUI and it comes back fine.

I went a step further. I would put her on the stand, and give her a treat if she pooped. After a couple of days of that, I would hold my finger a bit further from the stand, so she had to make a tiny hop to get to it (and then poop). Of course, she got a treat for doing this! Every day, I'd slowly increase the distance between my hand and her stand (maybe 5-10cm a day MAX, and that was only when she was learning fast) and reward her for taking the final section on her own and pooping. Now, I don't even have to move - she flies herself there. However, I do still reward her 95+% of the time she does it (either with a treat, or by picking her up so she doesn't have to fly back), since I've only had her 6 months I want it to be really solid before I start fading out rewards too much.","All commenters share tips on how to potty train a bird.

If they do poop on you, immediately bring them to the perch or playstand. The idea is to reward them with positive reinforcement rather than just the negative. It does take some time depending on your bird. I have found most birds are pretty easy to train. Even now I make it a habit to get up off the couch once an a while to see if she has to go. Even if she doesnt have to poop, she squats and tries. Its adorable!

Both games got their positive and negative aspects, which define each games.       So you cant say which game is better and which not.    If you are better at CSGO you will like csgo more than league.    Same the other way around.","Most commenters say that you can not compare the two games because they are so different. Another commenter states that it is impossible to tell which is better because different people like different things. One commenter says that they play League more often, but if they want an easy game where they do not have to try so hard, they play CS:GO.",55,reddit,1

I'd like to add one point often overlooked when buying new speakers: where they're placed in the room is important too!       If you find there is something wrong with your bass due to stationary waves (when there is one particular bass note that resonates super loud due to the physical length of your room matching the length of one full wave cycle), consider changing your desk layout. For example, you could place it diagonally in the corner and have  the speakers face the opposite corner where the closet is.

I was looking into the Yamaha HS8s they seem incredibly accurate and reliable for their price range, I make electronic music so being able to monitor the low end is really important to me. I'm not sure about the room size for the 8"" monitors?  Would I be better of with 5-6"" or am I wasting my effort with this room?       I'm really in the dark here but I really want a pair of monitor speakers to improve my music. I've been using exclusively ATM-M50 headphones and nothing I make sounds the same on other sources (cars speakers, earbuds, etc).      Also, what are my the best desk placement / audio treatment options in here? As it stands it's an empty room with a computer desk and chair, thin curtains on my window and old hardwood floors. There's not much reverb in here being a small room, but the odd shape (the closet) I'd assume there would be a lot of problems with bass?","I really like them, and they work well for my small-ish room size.

Not saying it's a bad video, just that my brain doesn't learn that way. For starters, banjo is first a *rhythm* instrument. One can play very melodically but the foundation is the rhythm not the melody. When I get super fancy (for me) - lots up the neck etc I'm still basically playing a rhythmic pattern and the notes are supporting the rhythm not the other way around. It wasn't until I started fiddle a few years ago that I realized that the actual notes matter -  because on the fiddle they do (a lot) but on the banjo they don't so much.      So if I were learning this, I'd find a sample or teacher that started with a super-simple rhythm. Bum ditty is fine. Just play simple chords, just close enough to sing along. Add one or two - no more - melody notes here and there. Then, play the crap out of it until it's second nature. Then, add one or two more melody notes, and play the crap out if that for a while.       For me, ""a while"" usually means days, weeks even months - for others more talented an hour or two should suffice.       The idea is that it should be enjoyable - it should *feel* like you're playing the song, instead of feeling like a science project.","Several commenters think that it is challenging to learn from videos or that this video is more difficult to learn from.

The real music comes from having fun and feeling like you're *playing* - and either approach will get you there.      To me, banjo has this magical third dimension, where the melody IS the rhythm. A strongly played melody - no brushes or ""bum ditty"" at all - can still sound amazingly rhythmic and deliver a great pulse or ""tick tock"" too. But it takes a while playing to get to that point - and the way to get there is to *play*.","Several commenters think that it is challenging to learn from videos or that this video is more difficult to learn from. Different users suggest learning the rhythm first, while others suggest learning the melody first.

If you're on Windows XP, Vista, or 7, then with the current dogecoin client closed, go to Start, Run, and paste this in:          %appdata%\Dogecoin      In Windows 8, tap the start charm or press the windows key on your keyboard, then paste this in:          %appdata%\Dogecoin      This will take you to where your Dogecoin folder resides. In here, there's a wallet.dat file. Copy that to another folder, anywhere outside of this directory. If you're particularly paranoid, copy it to a removable storage device or three.      Next, pick up a copy of [Dogecoin Core 1.8](http://dogecoin.com/) from the Dogecoin website.      Install it, but do not open the client yet.       If you have 5.4 GB of data to use, [download the bootstrap file](https://bootstrap.chain.so/) and follow its directions for placing (remember that line I had you paste earlier? You'll be going back in there to put that file in after it downloads).      After you grab the bootstrap file (or even if not), go ahead and open the Dogecoin client.      This **will** take a while to synchronize. Go grab a Snickers, or make dinner, or make sweet sweet love to your significant other, or take out the trash, walk the cat, and solve world hunger. Once some time has elapsed, you should be synchronized, and your existing wallet should show its contents.      ***Important***: No, you may not use Multidoge if you intend to recover the contents of your dogecoin-qt (Dogecoin Core) wallet file. No, don't send your wallet.dat to a stranger who promises they can see inside it and send you your dogecoins to a Multidoge wallet.",Most commenters advise on updating the poster's cryptocurrency wallet for dodge coins while keeping his money.

Then fire up 1.8 QT again and let it fully sync. It will replay your wallet as it syncs and everything should be fine - this will take a very long time so be patient.

You want to get as much money in the hand as possible when it's an advantage to you. If you're up against anything higher than a six, you don't want to be splitting sixes and fours. Never split 5's.       The only true BJ strategy other than counting, is to manage a bankroll, play basic strategy and not hunches, and don't bet what you can't afford to lose. Maybe in the short term you'll have some winning sessions, especially if you bet bigger if you notice the deck has been devoid of face cards and hit big on some 20s and blackjacks. Over time, everyone loses sans counting.      With your strategy, you would go dead broke because it is possible to lose more than 5 hands of blackjack in a row.

Could someone explain what the tax deferred bit means?      Do I need to do something with the ATO.      Hoping AusLaw includes tax law.      Thanks in advanced!","Ok, so I think you may be confusing ""dividend"" with ""distribution"" - I won't go into the detail explaining the difference.      However, a tax deferred distribution is just how it sounds - you receive an amount of money which you don't pay tax on now, you pay tax on it later.      A distribution can be fully tax deferred, or partially tax deferred - this just refers to the components making up the distribution, or the amount of money you have received.      This is also the case if you have your shares (or, in my assumption) stapled securities, on a dividend/distribution reinvestment plan - where you receive additional shares instead of a cash payment.      So, tax deferred - you pay tax on it later. But when? Well, what happens is that any tax deferred distribution you receive reduces your cost base for capital gains tax purposes. Thus you effectively pay tax later, by having a higher capital gain when you sell the securities.      By way of example:   You bought 5 000 securities at $1.00 = $5000.00 + $29.95 brokerage to ComSec. So, your total cost and your cost base for CGT purposes would be $5029.95      Then, you receive a tax deferred distribution of say $500.00      Your cost base after the distribution is now $4529.95.      You've physically received $500, but don't have to pay income tax on it in the financial year when you received it. Instead, your CGT cost base is reduced, and therefore you will ""pay more tax"" when you sell the investment at a later point in time.

When you purchase shares or units as an investor you hold then on capital account. That means that you do not get a tax deduction for the initial outlay. You only get the benefit of the initial outlay (I.e. The cost base) when you eventual dispose of the asset. When you dispose of an investment you reduce the capital proceeds (ie the sale price multiplied by the number sold less brokerage) by the cost base (ie the purchase price multiplied by the number bought plus brokerage). Where there is a gain (ie proceeds > cost base) you will include the gain as taxable income. If you hold the asset for more than 12 months you may be able to reduce the taxable amount by 50% if you were an Australian tax resident for the entire holding period. If you make a capital loss on the sale, then the loss is carried forward and can only be used to offset future capital gains. You cannot offset capital losses against taxable income.      In the scenario that you provided, if someone earned $50k from their job, purchased stables securities worth $5k (including brokerage) and received at $500 100% tax deferred distribution from said stapled securities (all in the same tax year) them taxable income will still be $50k,      Naturally there are many factors and tax laws that need to be taken into consideration and I do not know your exact situation.

After you have paid down your debt and have a healthy emergency fund, then you can invest for retirement.  If your employer matches your contributions to a company 401k retirement plan (meaning, you put in 5% of your pay, and they'll match 3% for free), then you should start making 401k contributions right away, because the employer match is free money.","Commenters offer their advice for settling a debt.

Often, this is negative because the company is underwater. It's not the case for PM. When you pay dividends or repurchase shares, it decreases the shareholder equity. When you depreciate an asset as an expense, it also decreases shareholder equity. The combination of these two things is the reason why many profitable companies have a negative shareholder equity. The assets on the balance sheet are actually worth more than what is shown, due to depreciation causing book value to be much less than actual value.",Most commenters explain why Phillip Morris has a negative book value but is still a smart investment and a profitable company that is not going anywhere.

Appreciate the help!","Just to follow up, I have confirmed that Jr Open Water Certification automatically upgrades to PADI Open Water. Outside of a ""card replacement fee"" (mine was $50...), you are good to go!","Commenters here are responding to a question about scuba diving certification options.  Some commenters feel that since it has been quite some time, like years, since they dived, the open water class would be a good place to start. Another commenter recommended wearing a dry suit while taking any of the courses.  Other commenters state that there have been changes to the recreational divers standard gear over the past several years and that most people may have forgotten what they have previously learned. Therefore,  retaking any class is highly advised.",146,reddit,1

I've had a few students who have come from teachers who focus on beginner/intermediate players who have attempted to teach them jazz.  The students come away with knowledge of the blues scale and a few vanilla-sounding root-position voicings.  We generally have to start over at the beginning.      Things in the classical world can be easier to teach because you're usually dealing with a set piece of music with very rigid rules.  There are still rules in jazz, but they are much more flexible and the amount of freedom can be overwhelming for student and teacher if they are unprepared.      Anyway, that's just my two cents.

Do you have the army cards for each of the figures/squads? Do a COMPLETE inventory of everything using boardgamegeek.com and be 100% transparent about what you are selling and what is missing/damaged.      With the volcano/ice sets you can make a good amount of cash selling everything you have as 1 big auction. Do a search on ebay for completed listings for ""heroscape lot"" and you'll see what stuff is going for.","Most commenters seem to think that the original poster should be able to re-jailbreak their phone, as long as they have at least 2.5 GB of storage remaining.

I just think that it makes WAY too much sense that with adding those picks we would trade up in next year's draft. What would our pressing needs be? Well, Adrian is going to be 31 then and costing us around 18 MILLION. Plus, we did not plan ahead for this year by drafting a power/replacement running back to groom.

Then I guess just try and find producers to work with. Network well and build a social following or become friends with producers, as well as join facebook groups aimed at music production etc      If you're a good writer/ vocalist and you work with someone who has a decent following you can start to branch out I guess      If you're keen to do some vocals on a Melbourne Bounce track then send over a preview of what you can do and I might consider working with you in the future. I have a little over 2k followers on soundcloud but there are heaps of producers that want to work with vocalists :)","All commenters share their favorite my little pony threads on tumbler.

Therefore, you could do 5 sets of 9 second eccentrics to provide enough stimulus for growth.  By set, it is do the eccentric, rest 2 -3 minutes, then do another until you have done a total of 45 seconds.  Try to increase to 10 when you can, and do 5 sets of 10 for 50 seconds. etc.  Make sure the total time falls within the specified range.      That is my understanding from the book and the public article.      **EDIT:** Ok, found [this post](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=89&hilit=eccentrics) on the EMI forums where Steven is talking about how he used eccentrics to develop a One Arm Chin.  He said 3-5 mins rest, then once you hit a total of about 30 seconds total stimulus you can start reducing rest time in between.  Once you can do all the eccentrics back to back you should be able to do the concentric movement.      BTW, buy the book, Overcoming Gravity.  It is really great for this kind of thing.

I stopped buying cheap backpacks, because you need to replace them too often, and if you dont spend a decent amount on one, it is not too great for your back. Herschel, for one, makes a good looking bag, but they are terrible. Thin/flimsy shoulder straps that once you pack the bag full will hurt, and will just dig into your back. There is literally nothing between your back and whatever is in your bag.      Honestly, I said this elsewhere, but when it comes to backpacks, think about your body first, and the look of the bag second. Sure, it is important to have a good looking bag, but you want something cushioned, and with a good structure, so even when it is full it will sit comfortably on your back. The North Face has some good bags, but if you are willing to spend some money, there are some VERY good bags that will last you many years.       I currently use [this](https://www.goruckgear.com/gear/details/GR1) from GORUCK and even when it is filled with bricks, it is still comfortable. It has been to hell and back and only looks better. I also used this bag from [The North Face](http://www.thenorthface.com/catalog/sc-gear/equipment-daypacks/base-camp-hot-shot_3.html?from=subCat), and it was very good, it looks good in all black, and great support for your back. If you get the all black, the logo is blacked out which makes it pretty low-key. I don't like labels showing, so I particularly liked that color-way.",Most commenters share that it is unlikely that the poster can upgrade the video card in their laptop.

So, I know that she likes me. And I'm pretty sure she knows that I like her. But... I think she saw me texting another girl last Thursday, who is one of my closest friends. She's just a friend, nothing more, nothing less. But, she was looking at my screen and I think she got a misunderstanding of the intention I was texting for. She started to get weird after she saw me text her.      She would take glances at me and she would make eye contact, but she wouldn't say anything. She would make physical contact (chest, arm, etc.) but wouldn't actually say anything to me. She seems to be in a state of nervousness, but I don't know how to break her out of it. If I try to talk to her, she just freezes... Making it awkward for the both of us. How do I break out of this?      By the way, we aren't dating yet.            tl;dr: Girl acts awkward around me.
