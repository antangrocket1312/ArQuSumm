Choosing one or the other can  depend on how long  a dish is cooking.  Dried herbs take a while to impart flavor  so they're mostly useful for longer cooking dishes. Also, getting a piece of dried herb that  hasn't had time to hydrate & soften can be really offputting  to eat! Often, however,  I use both- dried or sturdier herbs at the beginning & fresher/more tender herbs at the end  when the dish is pulled off the heat. That way you get  layers of flavor , not just top notes.","A couple of commenters suggest that there are some cases where dry herbs are better than fresh, such as when making dry rubs or when heating herbs for a long time, which would otherwise discolor them. Several commenters also endorse which herbs they like better dry versus fresh, but there is not a consensus on which way is better for specific herbs; people have different opinions. Another thing mentioned is that fresh herbs can't be stored for as long as dried, generally.",2,stack,1

That's why it is not called ""Star Wars Episode 3&half;: Rogue One"", but ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"".  And, let's face it, ""Episode 3&half;"" would be kind of a stupid title!

They require balance.  In all our examples so far, we’ve used “nor” to indicate a negative state that continues after something else negative happens. However, when the second negative item is a noun, adjective, or adverb phrase (4), you should use “or” to continue the negative thought because according to Bryan Garner “the initial negative carries through to all the enumerated elements” (5). For example, when you use the word “not,” the structure “not A or B” is correct. You’d have to say, “He is not interested in math or science”; “He is not interested in math nor science” won’t work. Likewise, “She didn’t speak slowly or clearly” has a better ring to it than “She didn’t speak slowly nor clearly.”  [BUT] When to Use Either “Nor” or “Or”  If, on the other hand, the second part of the negative is a verb phrase—not a verb clause—then you can choose to use “nor” or “or” (6).

If you’re unsure which word to use, or if you want to avoid the problem, you can try saying, “and no” for the second part of the negative (7): “I have no time and no money.” The phrase “and not” will also work: “Santa will not permit naughty behavior and will not even consider bringing presents.”","Several commenters suggest ways to correctly reword the example sentence, such as using not/or, or neither/nor.

It's not a universal rule, but in general, you can generate a noun that refers to the process of the verb — ""a developing"" sounds odd to me, but other examples, like ""a ripening"" (as in  we can observe the ripening of the fruit ) work for me.  But my main point is that even if you can generate an  -ing  noun from a verb, there's no reason to assume it would mean the same thing as a noun ending with  -ment  generated from the same verb. To respond directly to your first sentence, it's not that some verbs have a corresponding noun, but rather that many verbs have  many  corresponding nouns. If they always meant the same thing, we wouldn't need different suffixes.","Several commenters explain that nouns with -ing do not necessarily have the same meaning as -ment nouns because it is generally verbs that have corresponding nouns.

Given that Ron defines a Mudblood as someone with non-magic  parents , the implication would be that non-magic  grand parents do not make someone a Mudblood.   On the other hand, the underlying idea of blood-status is that some people diluted their pure wizard blood with Muggle blood. If your blood is merely diluted then you’re a Half-Blood, but if you’re blood is entirely Muggle then you’re a Mudblood. If all four of your grandparents are Muggles then your parents likely had no wizard blood.

Flavored water:  Lemon juice can make it a good meal companion if you are fine with unsweetened drinks. You have two more options there.   Plus of Herbal tea for a more focused flavor (Chaya leaf [Cnidoscolus aconitifolius] is simillar to brocolli water taste). Temperature is your choice.  A little of salt and chilli powder* if you are related to the joy of drinking the broth made by eating picks of square chopped aliments (fruit, sausage, cheese, chips, corn, etc.) as a snack. Preferrably warm/hot.   Consommé:  Chilli powder*, soy/hot sauce*, lemon juice, salt, peper, garlic, matching spices, chopped onion and green chilli, milk products and dressings, make it a good clear soup to drink it warm/hot just as it is. You can also add some complements in little pieces like bread (croutons), solid cheese (Panela, Gouda, etc.), more vegetables or even use it to cook your ramen noodles.  General purpose Broth:  The consommé serve as a great seasoning for grains, legumes, meat, seafood and vegetable hot soup.  Don't consider only wheat flour to make bread with the water.

]",How can I pour a concrete pad with a circular hole in it?,"John, you undoubtedly found a solution some years ago, but this kind of situation will likely surface again for other DIY's. I'd suggest considering using Sonotubes, if they are readily available. Yes, they typically are used for making tall columns (I've used them for building 9 foot high, 1 foot diameter pillars in an earlier backyard of mine), but they also have been used for concrete footings. The only difference in this latter instance is that you are pouring the concrete outside the Sonotube, rather than inside. The end result will be a well-defined, beautiful circle.  Sonotubes can be purchased in short lengths (expect the cost/foot to be higher for small height pieces, rather than for purchasing a full-size Sonotube), as well as different diameters. Ask your local supplier (checking availability at HD Supply or White Cap would be good starting place) to either cut exact dimensions for you, or buy a long enough piece and cut it yourself, marking it first and then cutting it carefully with an electric jig saw, or keyhole saw.  Stake the Sonotube in place along the inside. making certain that you already have in place any irrigation line and elbow (for the riser--that can be inserted following your pour) for the plant going in the circle.  Staking can be with 1/2"" diameter rebar, with lateral rebar pieces tied to the verticals, so as to hold the top of the tube in place. This assumes also that you have a firm base for the bottom of the Sonotube, that won't sink when dampening the ground prior to the pour (to extend the curing of the concrete, rather than having its moisture sucked quickly out by dry ground).  Hope this helps out future concrete pad endeavors!","Most solutions that commentators suggest are DIY or improvising everyday objects to fit the job.

Make sure both parents and other caregivers give each other breaks from the crying to recover. If it is just the two of you please find some help. Even as little as a couple hours once a week is important for your health and ability to have perspective.  Now, strategies for crying. Go through a cry reasons checklist in your head every time until your reaction is automatic, here are mine:   Wet (change diaper)   Hungry (feed)   Gas (Burp)   Cold/Hot (adjust amount of bed clothes)   Uncomfortable (check the baby's body for anything that could be an irritant: don't overlook things like clothing tags, detergent used, a hair wrapped around a baby's toe, perfume on a parent)   Tired (soothe and later ignore)   Upset/Angry (try to remedy the upsetting environment, soothe, or ignore)   If the baby is still crying you need to look outside healthy, normal reasons for crying. Start checking for such things as:   Rash  Fever  Alergies (what is mom eating that could be an alergy?)  Infection   Once you have a checklist in mind you need to keep track of a crazy amount of stuff: what is the baby eating, when, when is the baby sleeping, how long, any burps, how about diaper changes, and so on. If you have these things in mind you can start to identify what leads to crying in your baby. Keep it all in a little notebook and bring it with you to doctor visits just in case to help remind you of things. If your baby continues to cry call your doctor or nurse helpline. You may need to go in for a visit.","Commentators with children give a standard list including hunger, tiredness, pain, hot or cold, gas, a dirty diaper, and loneliness.

",Is there any difference between 'let me go' and 'let go of me'?,"This is an interesting question. As a native English speaker, it never occurred to me that the common phrase ""let go of me"" was so grammatically awkward (by modern standards, anyway). It probably reflects the speech patterns that were common at the time of its origin, which I'm guessing is way back in ye olde days. I can almost make sense of it if I close my eyes and imagine the dialog that might ensue if Shakespeare rudely grabbed someone by the wrist...   Someone:  ""LET GO!""  Shakespeare:  ""Would that I possessed the knowledge to fulfill thy command, sir. Yet verily thou hast failed to nameth yon object whereupon I am to act. Prithee tell,  of what  dost thou speaketh?""  Someone:  ""'Tis  of me  that I speaketh! LET GO  OF ME !""   (Now that I think about it, I bet there are a whole host of linguistic conundrums that can be solved by imagining someone grappling with Shakespeare). Apologies to anyone who hasn't been exposed to the weird medieval English spoken in  Shakespeare 's plays-- but hey, my English teachers made me read it, so....  Anyway, back on topic. I'm not entirely sure that there are any literal differences in meaning between the two phrases in question (that is, differences that could be deduced entirely through analysis of grammar and vocabulary, without taking common usage into consideration) although it's clear that they have come to mean two different things to modern English speakers.  In my mind, the command ""Let go of me"" applies to a subset of the situations in which the command ""Let me go"" could be used-- specifically, to those situations in which the entity being given the command is physically grasping the command giver. ""Let me go"" would work equally well in those situations, but it would also work in almost any situation in which the command giver's freedom of movement is being restricted somehow by the command receiver.  The phrase ""let go me"" would definitely be considered incorrect grammar, even though it appears to contain all of the information necessary to convey the intended meaning. So, why do we need the ""of""? Consider the phrase ""let go, me!"" That is (arguably) a grammatically-correct way of commanding oneself (or someone named Me) to let go, without identifying the object that is to be let go. The phrase ""let go  of  me,"" on the other hand, identifies the object that is to be acted upon rather than the entity that is to perform the action. So, maybe that's the purpose of the word ""of"", then-- to indicate that we're referring to the object and not the actor. Except...  Now consider the phrase ""release me!"" It is correct English, even without the ""of"". In fact, inserting an ""of"" would make it incorrect. Yet, somehow the native English speaker understands that it is the object, and not the actor, being referenced. In this case, English follows the exact same grammar rules as the OP's language-- rules that in the previous paragraph were deemed incorrect.  Ultimately, I'm forced to conclude that the phrase ""let go of me"" is yet another ""special case"" in a language which, I've been told, is largely comprised of special cases. In general, the word ""of"" means the same thing as the word ""about"", so mentally substituting that word (or an equivalent word in your language) may help with comprehension. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any general rule that you can use to determine whether the word ""of"" should or shouldn't be included in a particular sentence.","Commentators generally agree that “let go of me” refers to physical grasping instead of general imprisonment and that it is more commanding.

]",Has a libertarian party ever won a parliamentary election anywhere?,"Russian government of Yegor Gaidar of 1991-1992 conducted a policy which is often associated with Libertarianism in the West. This policy included:   Transition to market economy  Large scale privatization without adequate compensation to the state  Radical cuts in state expenses, including military, science, medicine and education  Reduction of free education and healthcare services  Removal of state price control  Removal of state regulation of the currency market and circulation. Allowing free circulation of foreign currency  Deregulation of most markets, including food, alcohol, tobacco, pornographic production, public transportation, retail, banking, mass media, security services  Removal of protectionist barriers and easing border control  Introduction of private property on land   Legalization of possession of means of self-defence  Support for regional separatism  Removal of criminal punishment for consumption of drugs and homosexualism   The government who conducted this policy stayed in power for a quite short time. The policy conducted is widely considered to have catastrophic effect.   The economy of the country deteriorated. Budget deficit and hyperinflation reached unseen heights. Crime rate, drug consumption, prostitution and infectious diseases skyrocketed. Several regions proclaimed sovereignty, including Chechen republic, which later led to a war. Industrial production dropped more than a half. Ethnic conflicts sharpened. Neo-Nazi, Jihadist and other extremist groups, as well as quasi-religious organizations flourished. Large scale frauds of the kind of Ponzi schemes and pyramids deprived millions of their possessions. Many enterprises stopped paying or heavily delayed wages.  This all led to a constitutional crisis of 1993 when the Supreme Council refused to approve Yegor Gaidar as a prime minister for a new term. The president Yeltsin then staged a coup and ordered to shoot the parliament building with tanks. After the crisis was resolved by adopting a new constitution, Yeltsin did not dare to appoint highly unpopular Gaidar again but the state policy continued the same in many respects, although not as radical as before. Yegor Gaidar's ideas were continued by the party ""Democratic Choice"" to whom he became a member.   In 1993 the party came second in the election due to overwhelming support by the press, after nationalist party LDPR. But in 1995 the party earned only 3,5% votes which was insufficient to get any seats in the legislature and later was disbanded.","The commenters mention several countries that have had libertarians elected in the government, such as the Australian Sex Party, the Libertarian Estonian Reform Party, and the Yegor Gaidar Russian government between 1991-1992. Another party, the UK Independence Party, is mentioned, but it is disputed if they are really libertarians by the person who posted it and another commenter. One commenter goes into detail about why the Libertarian Party doesn't get many strongholds anywhere: the party itself is about limiting government.",26,stack,1

",Is potty-training in 3 days possible?,"I'm not familiar with the book, but I can tell you my experience with my first child. He started showing interest in bathroom and waking up with a dry diaper. My wife was on vacation and I was going to have a long weekend so we decided to give it a try.   We sat down with him and explained the whole thing, and how he was now a big boy and he was ready to use the potty. At first it was very scary for him. Sitting was fun, we read him a story or showed him a video from Elmo, and he was very happy, but when he felt he was about to pee, he started yelling a lot, as if it was a bad thing. We faced the same situation on a previous attempt and we quit trying then. But know we kept on trying, we told him everything was going to be alright and it was OK to pee in the potty. He finally did it and started to be less scared every time. Every time he pee in the potty we gave him a price such as a gummy bear or a little chocolate. Next day he was going every time with just one accident and he has been fine ever since.  He was on his underwear the whole time (no training diapers, except when we went to the store or grandma's). And at night we would sleep with his training diapers. After a month or so without wetting the training diapers, we decided that he could sleep without them.  I think the most important thing is to notice when the kid is ready and make him as comfortable as possible. If there are accidents, don't make a big deal out of it, just have him help you out to clean. If he succeeds, make sure to make a big deal and regard him with hugs and maybe a little treat as well.

Other characteristics which factor into the voicing are (not necessarily exhaustive):   which order (top to bottom) do the notes appear in?  what is the spacing between the notes?  which notes (if any) have been omitted?  which notes (if any) have been doubled?  in ensemble settings, which instruments are playing which notes in which registers? (i.e. orchestration)","Many of the users in this thread write about complicated music theory concepts. Two commenters explain that inverting involves changing a chord structure while keeping the same bass note, but voicings do not require this. One commenter also explains that one can use an inversion as a first step to changing a chord's voicing and also explains how to extend a chord from beginning to end, starting with an inversion. That user and one other also talk about how extended chords can lead to bad or dissonant sounding chord structures.",32,stack,1

]",How do inversions of extended chords work?,"The way I see it is that the inversion will establish the lowest note on a chord, while the voicing is the specific arangement of harmonics used when playing that chord.   That right.   But this becomes blurry in my mind when using extended chords.   Let's first point out that seventh chords can put any chord tone into the bass including the seventh. Ex.  C: V4/2  would be  F G B D  with the seventh in the bass, typically resolving down to the third of the tonic chord in  I6 . Without question that is totally conventional harmony.  Now let's consider extensions to be the intervals high than the seventh: ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths. The seventh should be present with those extensions so they aren't mixed up with simple intervals  add2 ,  sus4 ,  add6 , etc.  The conventional treatment would be to place the extensions above the chord root. (Walter Piston's  Harmony  is my source for that point. His text is concern with roughly Bach to Brahms with later Romantics like Grieg and Dvorak, so fairly conservative.) I think the rationale is that putting the extensions in the bass can give the impression of other chords with some added non-chord tones or their own extensions!  Consider a basic  G7  and the extensions above. Put the ninth in the bass and it sounds like an  Am9  on the bottom with two appoggiaturas, put the eleventh in the bass and it sounds like a  Cmaj9 , put the thirteenth in the bass and it sounds like an  Em7  with a  b9  or a non-chord tone of some kind.  So for all practical purposes, conventional handling sets the inversion ""limit"" at third inversion. And for clarity's sake put the extensions above the root, but you probably have a lot of freedom with the specifics of the voices above the root.","Many of the users in this thread write about complicated music theory concepts.

Open voicings use whatever notes are appropriate, but will not use every consecutive note from that chord. All voicings are subject to root or inversions.

]","What is a word or an idiom for ""an act that makes alive something inanimate""?","The word  galvanize  came to my mind. It seems to often take as its object the noun  corpse  and seems to apply predominantly to (dead) biological objects. From a  ""galvanize * corpse""  search at Google Books:   Now within our own time there arose an unfortunate fuss which threatened (as Mr. Turnbull would say) to  galvanize the corpse  of Christianity into a fictitious life—­the alleged case of a Highland eccentric who wanted to fight for the Virgin. (Chesterton)   Note that the life produced by  galvanization  is fictitious, not full-fledged. The same aspect is stressed in the following quote:    Madame Rachel can only  galvanize  the corpse, not  revivify  it. Ancient French tragedy, red-heeled, patched, and be-peri- wigged, lies in the grave; and it is only the ghost of it that we see, which the fair Jewess has raised. (Thackeray,  Paris Sketch Book )   Here we've struck upon another verb:  to revivify . Also partially useful for your purpose: it applies only to objects that were initially alive. You cannot revivify a broomstick or a brickbat. I guess that you cannot  galvanize  them either. But at least you can  revivify  a body to a real, not make-believe, life.   There's another word: to  vitalize . An  example  of usage:   The power of God  vitalized  the world to the extent that his spirit infused life into dead matter.    This word seems be closer in its meaning to something like ""infuse with life power"". Thus, ""I used a magic spell to  vitalize  my toy soldiers"" might seem a bit strange.   Per Dangph's note, there's also the verb  vivify . Also close to ""infuse with vital power"", also used in high-style sentences.   Tappert also makes some interesting comments on the tempo rubato with which Wagner  vivified  the Ninth Symphony..","One commenter suggests a famous Christmas song may be used as a suggestion to bring something to life.

",Can rock salt be used for sewer maintenance?,"I was able to find a reference to this in chapter 22 of  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Household Solutions .     Though honestly, I've never heard of this approach until now. I'm no expert on the corrosiveness of salt, but I would imagine the levels of salt in the sewer would not be high enough to rust the pipe. I'm also skeptical that the salt levels would be high enough to completely kill and prevent the roots. While I wouldn't recommend pouring a bag for rock salt down the drain, a handful once or twice a month will probably not hurt the pipe.  There are other tried and true methods to remove roots from sewer lines.  Mechanincal  Augers  Augers can be used to effectively remove roots from a sewer line, by cutting the roots out. This is not likely a solution for a DIYer, since it involves expensive specialty tools.  This method will not prevent roots from growing back into the sewer.  Hydrojetters  A hydrojetter is essentially a power washer with a rotating mechanical ""sweeper"", that is designed to be fed into the sewer line and blast and sweep roots away. Again, this is not likely a DIY option and does not prevent the roots from regrowing.  Digging  In some cases roots may have caused too much damage to the sewer line, and the only option available is to dig the line up and replace it. This can be very expensive, and will almost certainly not be a DIY project.  Chemical  Contact Herbicides  Contact herbicides are chemicals that will kill the roots, and in some cases prevent them from regrowing.  These are typically a more DIY friendly option, and can be found as simple ""pour down"" solutions.  Contact herbicides can include:   Bensulide  Copper Sulfide  Dichlobanil  Dinoseb  Metham sodium  Paraquat  Potasium Hydroxide  Sulfamic Acid  Trifluralin   A common product recommended by plumbers is  RootX . This is a herbicide in a foaming carrying agent, that allows the herbicide to reach roots at the top of the pipe.  RootX uses Dichlobenil, and is non-caustic, non-fumigating, and non-systemic. Unfortunately, it's not readily available to homeowners, so you'll likely have to contact a plumber for this treatment.  Searching around, I stumbled upon a product similar to RootX that is available to homeowners.  Roebic® Foaming Root Killer  is available at  Lowes  for about $20.00. It foams up, and uses dichlobenil as the herbicide just like RootX.  Make sure you check with your local municipality and environmental agencies, before pouring chemicals down your drain  Planning  One of the best ways to prevent roots from entering your sewer line, is to carefully plan where you plant trees and other deep rooting plants.","Commentators are split on the effectiveness and safety of rock salt.

Practice spitting watermelon seeds and things that do NOT taste good like his toothpaste probably does (explain this behavior is only for really special times like in the bathroom and adult condoned spitting contests).    Have a family contest in the backyard.  Then, when you know he CAN spit (because now he has gotten help from you, siblings neighbors etc and shown you he's pretty good at it right?), you can use water swishing to help him have enough ""stuff"" to spit when brushing his teeth - just don't use so much you negate any effects of ongoing protection.    You might also try making a game out of it like, how long can you brush without swallowing OR spitting?  Brush together and see who ""wins"".  If you aren't having a contest, just encourage him to spit more often than you would yourself, use an egg timer to have him spit every 30 seconds or so. . .  Make it fun and silly, he'll laugh, you'll laugh and maybe he'll get it.","Commenters suggested solutions from their own experiences, such as practicing spitting out water or other things like watermelon seeds.

]",Do “asymmetric” and “dissymmetric” have different meaning?,"In an etymological approach to asymmetry, we must refer to the Greek word ἀσυμμετρία that means disproportion. In other words, asymmetry is a lack of symmetry that implies another element for making a comparison. This is an aseptic meaning. A situation where a heterogeneous element is introduced, breaking the proportionality of the parts, between them and in relation to the whole.   A second meaning, in a pejorative sense, what we call  dissymmetry  – the prefix dis- expresses negation or completeness or intensification of an unpleasant or unattractive action-, will be applied to those situations where a proportional or symmetrical situation was broken in an anomalous or faulty way (i.e. for political pressures, the threat of secession or self-determination, the confusion between powers –if you have differences in culture, religion, language… you could reach more powers in economy, social services or foreign policy or more representatives in State institutions-).

",As we know Crabbe and Goyle Sr were both Death Eaters: What were their jobs in the magical world?,"They likely were ‘respectable’ - the Malfoys associated with them.  Though it’s not clear what either Crabbe’s or Goyle’s jobs were, or even if they had joined or were independently wealthy, Crabbe can be presumed to have a respectable position. Lucius Malfoy was willing to both associate with him himself, and let his son associate with and befriend Crabbe’s son before they began attending Hogwarts. This implies Crabbe likely didn’t have a ‘lower class’ job.   In childhood, Draco associated mainly with the pure-blood children of his father’s ex-Death Eater cronies, and therefore arrived at Hogwarts with a small gang of friends already made, including Theodore Nott and Vincent Crabbe.  - Draco Malfoy (Pottermore)   Though Goyle’s son only met Draco at Hogwarts, he likely did too, since it’s unlikely that Draco would choose to befriend someone that his father would disapprove of.   It was, therefore, in the knowledge that he was doing nothing of which his father would disapprove, and in the hope that he might be able to relay some interesting news home, that Draco Malfoy offered Harry Potter his hand when he realised who he was on the Hogwarts Express.  - Draco Malfoy (Pottermore)   Since Draco very heavily patterned himself after his father, it’s unlikely he’d do something if he thought his father wouldn’t have wanted him to, so he probably wouldn’t choose to befriend someone below his status. Because of this, it’s likely that Goyle also didn’t have a ‘lower-class’ job.   Much of Draco’s behaviour at school was modelled on the most impressive person he knew – his father – and he faithfully copied Lucius’s cold and contemptuous manner to everyone outside his inner circle. Having recruited a second henchman (Crabbe being already in position pre-Hogwarts) on the train to school, the less physically imposing Malfoy used Crabbe and Goyle as a combination of henchman and bodyguard throughout his six years of school life.  - Draco Malfoy (Pottermore)   It’s not said exactly what either of their jobs were, but because of the Malfoys’ willingness to associate with them, they can be presumed not to have been below a certain social status.","Several of the commenters think that Crabbe Sr and Goyle Sr must have come from wealthy families and did not need to have jobs.

If someone was standing there waving a baton in front of you, they would be counting the half-notes, and counting two beats per measure (2/2 time as you said).  If it says ""moderato"" on top of the page it would refer to the speed of the half-notes and if there is a bpm marking it would also refer to the half-notes, although it's common to make this explicit by writing ""half-note = tempo"" (see top two examples here  http://www.janvanbiezen.nl/bachfig01.gif ).  This is common in marching band music where writing in 2/4 would look awkward (I guess?).",Commentators generally agree that cutting the time in half does not actually increase the tempo and so would be played at the same speed. Some commentators note that it would double if you keep the tempo the same as in 4/4 time. A few commentators surmise that the book was trying to contrast two meters to show the difference.,62,stack,1

]",What is the silver strip behind crystal in the PCB?,"I wish I could find an image of this, but that is a ground pad.  When mounting larger crystals, like the one shown in Peter's answer, it is normal to bend the leads so the can is laid flat on the board to limit the height of the board envelope. (Note it does little with the crystal shown in your image.)  Unfortunately, when mounted flat in that position the thing is rather easy to move and will catch on things and bend up, eventually breaking the leads in extreme circumstances. The thing will also vibrate in a mechanically noisy environment.  As such it needs to be tied down.  Note the two holes on either sides of the pad. It is common to see a strap, made of an offcut of an axial component lead, bent to fit over the crystal and soldered into those holes with a further dab of solder where the strap touches the case on top to form a good ground for the case. Other times you may see a single hole at the top of the crystal for a single wire post or hook instead.   The reason for the big pad itself is a little less obvious than it first appears. The can on crystals is normally isolated from the pins, and as such it is prudent to solder the case down to a ground pad. (Why they don't have three pins to make it easy to ground the case has always eluded me...)  However, why the pad needs to be as large as the can is not so clear.  Crystals don't get hot so it is not for heat-sink reasons, and since the crystal is already enclosed in its own little Faraday cage, when grounded, E.M. radiation reasons don't make much sense either.

]",Serial to USB converter,"4. Any other considerations?  Yes.  Classic serial ports are ordinarily byte-oriented, ie, one character at a time with quite low latency.  USB is inherently packet-oriented, with comparably high-latency.  In other words, USB is great for moving a lot of data at once, but it's actually slower at moving tiny amounts of data.  If you try to move a lot of data in tiny pieces with USB, you lose -  badly .  For just typing on a terminal program talking to a modem or an embedded device, or even uploading files, etc, this is really not a problem, because single doses of the latency are small in human terms, and the USB can easily move blocks of data fast enough keep up with any serial baud rate.  But other protocols which depend on constant back-and-forth of short messages or single characters between a computer and a serial peripheral can slow to a crawl (or even mis-operate) when used with a usb-serial converter.  If a computer does something like send a single character, and wait for the peripheral to respond before sending then next, then the character rate is determined by the latency for two entire usb packets - one to send a single character, and one to receive one (it may even be worse - the receive might at the lowest level involve poling).  In today's world where USB-serial converters are as or more common than real serial ports, its important to design protocols so that you can send out a lot of data, before needing to wait for a reply.  With legacy systems, you may get lucky and find it works fine, it may work but slowly, or it may not work reliably at all.  And even within a given protocol, peripheral, computer, and operating system driver, the design of the client software matters.  I once encountered a piece of management software for an embedded device which had been written and tested by a contractor using a real serial port.  It turned out to use some variation of .NET serial calls that turned out to be ""watch the results crawl in"" slow on a laptop with a usb-serial converter.  My own previous simple win32 management tool for that device ran without apparently delay on the same laptop with the same converter.  Perhaps I wrote better code, but given that the converter was my ordinary test environment, if there had been a similar problem with my code, I would have been lucky enough to find it while there was still time to fix the problem.  Moral of the rant  in todays world, anything (hardware or even client software) designed to use a serial port should be tested for usability with usb-serial converters early enough in its development that the design can be changed to fix any issues discovered.","Most commenters recommend purchasing a serial converter as it will be cheaper and easier than trying to build one yourself.

]",Floating glove scene in Man of Steel. What does it mean?,"The Power of Imagery  Warning: This answer is about the artistic reason(s) for the levitating glove, not scientific reasons .  If you're into such things,  Man of Steel  is rich with imagery and symbolism. Sometimes it's conspicuous, such as when Clark is at a church and the camera pauses ever so briefly with an anguished Clark in front of a crucified Christ. Sometimes it's a lot more subtle, such as when Jor-El's image is directing Clark and Lois on the ship, and it's all done with classical poses similar to those in Greco-Roman statues: This totally jibes with Kryptonian society in the movie being based heavily on Plato's ""Republic."" Another subtle one is the ""baptism"" of Clark when he goes through a trial by fire and ends up immersed in the ocean.  Anyways, as far as  imagery  goes, a gauntlet is a symbol of power. (side note: the difference between a glove and, more specifically, a gauntlet is, generally speaking, that a gauntlet is used in battle/war). Notice that it's not just the case that the viewer can see a gauntlet floating---it's actually the case that the glove is foregrounded in a shot, taking up almost the entire frame, and the camera ever so subtly pauses there for  just  a brief moment.  So I would suggest that scene may have been less about a scientific reason and more about an artistic and symbolic message. Zod has just expressed his view that, essentially, might-makes-right when it comes to protecting Krypton (says something about even his ""cruelty"" was to serve Krypton's greater good). The glove symbolizes his power philosophy.","Commentators generally agree that Zod was likely manipulating the gravity around his body, causing the glove to float as he was about to fly himself.

Merriam-Webster only has entries for  alright  and  all right , and this  usage discussion :   The one-word spelling  alright  appeared some 75 years after  all right  itself had reappeared from a 400-year-long absence. Since the early 20th century some critics have insisted  alright  is wrong, but it has its defenders and its users. It is less frequent than  all right  but remains in common use especially in journalistic and business publications. It is quite common in fictional dialogue, and is used occasionally in other writing <the first two years of medical school were  alright  — Gertrude Stein>.

I can't seem to a good reference again (all I find now are cheese snobs thumbing their nose at low-moisture mozzarella, or gourmands insisting that only full-fat cheese is acceptable), but I remember some years ago finding a site put up by a restauranteer discussing pizza cheese, that helped me solve the pizza woes I was having at the time.  The site noted that cheeses on the high end of ""low-moisture"" would result in exactly what I was getting to come out of the oven from my 50% moisture brand: an unappetizing translucent gray cheese, with a slight bitter flavor.

","How can I test for there being 0 entities? As in, do something when there are no iron golems in a certain radius?","Make an if else statement. For example.Start by creating a scoreboard.  /scoreboard objectives add IfElse dummy  With this scoreboard you will detect if something succedeed or not. You will be using the score 0 for when something didnt happend(A testfor failed.) and the score 1 if something suceeded.  Laying down a clock, were you put your first command block to repeating, on a piece of redstone. Now for a score to be carried you need a Armorstand. So summon an armorstand that has the name ""IfElse1"" or something.  Now, for the first block in your command block line you want to set the amorstand(s) scores to 0, so that every time the clock finishes testing for scores/change them, they will be put back to normal. (Score 0)  /scoreboard players set @e[name=IfElse1] IfElse 0                    (Armorstand)and(Scoreboard)  If your going to be using sereval IfElse statements in your contraption i suggest giving it a tag, so that you can target and reset all your IfElse(x) armorstands easily only using one command block. So something like this:  /scoreboard players set @e[tag=IfElseAll] IfElse 0  So you could put this as your first command instead.  Next is were you wanna testfor the opposite of what you actually want to find out and get an output from, to know if something issnt true, you first need to find out what kind of output you will get from doing a check. So something like this  /testfor @e[type=Player,r=20]   (Could add a region tag, to check within a box, or a tag, or anything that could be given to the player to count them as beeing in game.  Example:  tag:    /testfor @e[type=Player,tag=InGame]    score:    /testfor @e[type=Player,score_GameStatus_min=1,score_GameStatus=1]  Next you want to have a conditional command block.This commandblock will get an output if the test was successfull, or not be activated at all if it wassnt. Meaning this is were you would put your output from there beeing players in the game.But were trying to find the opposite, so you put the following.  /scoreboard players set @e[name=IfElse1] IfElse 1  This will change the armorstands default score(0). To 1. Indicating that there is players in the game. But if that is not the case. The score will remain(0). (If you would like an output from there beeing players in the game. you may put more conditional command blocks. But remember, if one fails the chain does not activate all the way.)  Now after your testing for players, you know know if theres players or not in your game, determined by the state of the score ""No players(0)"" ""Players(1)"".Now to get an output from there not beeing players in the game, do another testfor command in the same chain ""that is not conditional"".  /testfor @e[name=IfElse1,score_IfElse_min=0,score_IfElse=0]  (Checking for a miniumum of 0, and a maximum of 0 score for the armorstand ""IfElse1"" in the scoreboard ""IfElse"".)  Now make another conditional command block chain, with whatever outputs you might want. For there beeing no players in the game.  And you should be all set.  No comparators, or redstone needed.","Commenters explain how the command should be formatted, indicating that the formula should include what should be tested for, the type, and the radius.

In other words, there are no studies showing that passive voice is more effective in communicating technical information. That leaves us with social reasons, which are necessarily a little more speculative and anecdotal. There is history to suggest that the following may be factors:   People often feel that because documentation is a ""business document"" it must be formal, and they often feel that the passive voice sounds more formal than the active voice. Neither of these propositions is true but they seem to be frequently held by people whose training and experience is not in communications.   The passive voice can be used to conceal the actor. ""John hit Frank"" becomes ""Frank got hit"" with the accusatory ""by John"" elided out. Thus it absolves the speaker either of taking responsibility or of assigning it. Communicators who seem unsure of themselves or who don't really want to communicate at all often take refuge in the passive to avoid taking or assigning responsibility.   If people are in a field where passive documentation is common, they may simply copy that style.

]","Feminine equivalent of ""priapic""","For starters, you ask for a feminine equivalent in your question, but the original phrase does not necessarily (and in the case of pirates, is unlikely to) refer to same-sex-encounters.  Now, the word  priapic  originates from the name of a minor Greek god, who was know for his, let's say, outspokenly present and continuously active masculinity.  One option would be to find a female equivalent, and the one that comes to mind is Aphrodite or Venus.   The adjective for Venus is venereal, but I doubt  venereal  conquests would have any positive ring to it, because of the common association with venereal diseases. You could try  aphroditic  conquests , maybe.  Alternatively, you could look for something more physical, as  priapic  is a direct hint at the erect penis. Although some parts of a female body may become erect, I am not sure that those erections evoke the same image or impact as the priapic one.However, you could throw in (an allusion to) some other parts of the female anatomy.  Labial  conquest comes to mind, but it might mean that they relatively innocently kissed someone. Vulvic  conquests would be an option I guess, descriptive of the kind of conquest.You could play around with adjectives based on less formal nouns for the female anatomy, but I will leave that up to your own imagination and what you see fit for the context.","Commentators largely agree that a female version of “priapic” is hard to come by or use. Suggestions from commentators include “sapphic”, “aphroditic,” “labial,” and “venereal.” Some commentators note that this difficulty arises from Greek mythology, as “priapic” comes from a Greek god with a permanent erection, while there is no female equivalent.",90,stack,1

Thus, you can apply  equilibrium brining  and brine your meat for a longer time in a less concentrated solution. I haven't tried it, but according to linked source you'll get desired results if you brine white meat in 1-1.5% salt for 20-30% longer than you normally would. Since the solution isn't saltier than you want your meat, you can basically leave in the brine for as long as you like (standard food safety issues apply, of course).","Lots of commentators report good results from brining a turkey for 48 to 72 hours.

",What is this name of this kind of joint lock?,"This appears to be a hammerlock or ""chicken wing"", held with only one hand for ostensibly artistic purposes i.e. to imply Sherlock is so skilled he only needs to utilise a very small amount of movement/control to subdue an opponent.  In reality, such a hold is relatively insecure since Sherlock is not controlling Mycroft's arm/body in any way (other than pushing the wrist up); with no 'grip' to speak of, Mycroft could theoretically just turn clockwise and be free.   Most martial arts which teach joint locks teach similar techniques (hyper-rotating the shoulder joint by winding the arm up the back) but with much more stable control of the arm, either by using both arms to control the lock in a figure-four hold, or by using the other arm to control the opponent's body to some degree, preventing them from escaping.   Below are the names of some similar techniques (or techniques with one or more similar variations) in various disciplines:   Judo:   ude-hishigi-te-gatame   BJJ:  Kimura   Catch Wrestling:   Hammerlock   Aikido:  hiji-garami    And here are the names of some techniques which can attack the same joint (hyper-rotating the shoulder backwards), but are generally characterised by very different grips than one handed control of the arm (e.g. a figure-four hold):   Judo:  ude-garami  BJJ:  Kimura, Americana  Catch Wrestling:  Double wristlock/Chickenwing  Aikido:  ude-gaeshi   And the following describe a similar lock secured with the legs:   Judo:   ude-hishigi-ashi-gatame , -hiza-gatame  BJJ:  Omoplata  Catch Wrestling:  Coil lock    Note that in both the Judo and catch-wrestling variations above, when only one hand is being used to apply the lock the other hand is very purposefully being used to restrain the opponent's body.

You can connect a chain of these chips together, so that the output of a Q7S goes to it's neighbor's DS. Then, take an SPI output of your main micro and connect it to the chain. The micro's SPI-MOSI should connect to the free DS chip and then SPI-CLK should connect, in parallel, to all of the SHCP pins. Then, use a free I/O to pulse all of the STCP pins.

Fresh tomatoes contain natural enzymes which will break down pectin and other other thickening components.  By heating rapidly to a boil (or nearly so) at first, you will deactivate these enzymes.   Then  reduce to a low simmer to preserve flavor components during the remainder of cooking.  If you don't do this first step, the sauce will turn watery and you'll spend a much longer time thickening it again by reduction (or other means).  For more details see Kenji Lopez-Alt's  Q&A here  (where he quotes Harold McGee's similar advice on the same topic).  (Note that this advice only applies to sauce made from fresh tomatoes.

They might also do this to gauge why you haven't had a job yet (i.e. are you competent?) Make sure not to bluff about other opportunities too much.   I know one interviewee who said he only applied for one other job (to make himself look loyal) and he came across as lazy, spoiled, not proactive.  You can safely insist that it's private.

I can honestly say that I can probably call up and find managers within most of the big shops.

Chances are they might actually be having beers with this person every third Friday, or something to that effect.

They probably just want to make sure you're not interviewing with Google (in which case, your interview process might take half a year, and when you get the offer they won't be able to compete - not a good idea to invest in the hire).

",How to leave Hong Kong International Airport by foot,"Hong Kong airport is on an island. There is nothing else on that islands except an exhibition center and related activities (ferry terminal, hotel, …). In order to go anywhere interesting, you need to cross to the neighboring island of  Lantau , Tung Chung being the first neighborhood when going from the airport to anywhere overland. While I think there is a pedestrian walkway along the western road bridge, I doubt that it's a pleasant walk (though a  Wikivoyage  contributor describes it as “nice” — I'm guessing this refers to the view rather than the ambiance), and it's a minimum of 4km from the airport terminal to the town (more like 5km to get anywhere interesting). You can check  Google Maps  (complete with Street View).  With only two hours' layover, taking account the time to go through security, you do not have time to walk. If the two hours are rounded down, you may have time, but walking isn't the best use of your time.  There are frequent  buses  between the airport and the Tung Chung MTR station, but they are not especially fast. If you take a bus, note that you can you can only pay by  Octopus card  or exact change. You can buy an Octopus card at the airport, but I don't remember if you can pay with a foreign credit card, and it has a HK$150 minimum value (you can redeem the unused portion afterwards minus a small charge; in comparison the return bus fare is HK$7).

]","Why did the writers select the date November 5, 1955 in Back to the Future?","TL;DR. 1955 was chosen because it was exactly 30 years  before the date that the screenplay was finalised . November 5th was chosen  because it met the requirements of the script and the dates of filming .   1955  When Bob Gale completed the original  first draft screenplay  in February 1981, Marty's destination was March 2,  1952 , anticipating a 1982movie release.   MARTY:   1952?? This is 1952?!? Holy Shit!! You know what this means?? I’ve gone back in time 30 years! 30 goddamn years!!! I haven’t even been born yet!!!!   When the  final draft screenplay  was completed in 1984, the date of Marty's arrival in the past,  anticipating a 1985 release date , was then shifted to  1955 .   BROWN:   Here's a red letter date in the history of science: March 19, 1955   Presumably if the film had been delayed a year or another draft written a year later, the date would have been shifted to 1956 and so on.  This fits nicely with a recent comment by the Bob Gale about 30 years being ""a nice round number"", allowing audiences to experience a significant narrative shift but without being too far into the past or the future to make it unlikely that characters would still be around.   Q.   Why [did] you chose 2015 for second movie and not 2025 or any other year?  Gale:   As Doc Brown said: ""30 years. It's a nice round number."" The first movie dealt with a 30 year period, so we felt it was appropriate to continue that motif in the sequels. Besides, Marty's kids needed to be the same age that Marty was in 1985, and 2015 was the perfect year for that.  'Back to the Future' fans #AskBobGale: Your toughest questions answered   November 5th  Gale claims that the date was chosen to fit in with the  events of the script   Bob Gale:   November 5 happens to be my father's birthday. My father, I think, believes to this day that this is a great homage to him. It was just the right day with the right day of the week to make the thing work with the script.  Bob Gale:   We picked November because of the time of the year when we were shooting the movie, and of course to make sense that they would be having things like a school dance in school. We obviously couldn't have it take place in August, because there wouldn't have been any school.  Maker's Commentary: Disk 1   Presumably these events included a non-Prom related school dance (which excludes Feb-Aug), long bright sunlit days and an unseasonal thunderstorm. Having Marty spend a week in the past (Saturday 5th to Saturday 12th) gives him the opportunity to meet both his mother and father at the weekend before they spend a week at school with the dance on the following Saturday.","Commenters say that the date was not chosen randomly, but for several reasons, including being 30 years before the screenplay was finished, an important date in the author's life, or as an homage to another movie, or to honor Bill Gale's father.

I just watched a documentary on youtube about a real life scientist (Ronald L. Mallett) whose father died in 1955 at age 33. This caused him to spend his entire life trying to figure out a way to travel through time to save his father. So that he would not be considered crazy, he disguised his work as research of black holes. I believe the Nov. 5th part is an homage to Bob Gale's father, while the 1955 is a tribute to the real life scientist's dream of traveling through time to save his father's life. I believe that this man's courage and determination to follow his dream played a major role in inspiring the story of one of the greatest movies of all time. Here is the link as my evidence. Skip ahead to 10:00.     After doing further research, I found  a Huffington Post article written about the scientist (Ronald L. Mallett) . Here is an excerpt:   How are you planning on spending this historic week?  During the “Back to the Future” week I’m going to look at some of my  favorite time-travel movies which I have on DVD. Among them is the  1960 movie “The Time Machine” that starred the late Rod Taylor. In my  opinion, this is the best and most accurate depiction of H.G. Wells’  novel. I love that movie. I will also watch the “Back to the Future”  series. Incidentally, the first movie in the series has a special  meaning for me because Marty McFly goes back to 1955, which is the  year my father died.

]",Setting up ableton live as a live looper?,"I find that the best way to do it is with some kind of foot pedal switch, like the FC-50. By mapping Start, stop, undo, delete and next track to your foot switches, you can easily perform your loop in realtime, get it right, and then advance to the next scene or track when you want to record the next variation.  Looper is great for looping live audio, but is a little redundant for recording MIDI loops in realtime - since the built-in ableton live controls are a little more flexible. The challenge for me has always been seamlessly looping, overdubbing, and riffing in real-time and since I'm a keyboardist using both hands, the footpedal was the only way to go.  I just looked at the Kid Beyond video and I don't think he's using Looper - it looks like he's arming a series of different tracks, all of which he's routed his mic input to. He's got a 1-bar control sync on so he doesn't have to be 100% precise with his foot pedal punch-in/punch-out. It looks like he just has each pedal keyed to the record / play button for the same scene across different tracks. This is why he has to pause for a bar after each recording before arming the next track.

Ableton used to link to a tutorial on how to do it (how often do you see Ableton referencing any third-party software?) but they went ahead and made Looper which does some CRAZY stuff the Kid Beyond way couldn't (without Max, at least :) ) so they likely don't have the link anymore.

    ]
  }
]",Would this component require a heat sink?,"No, this would not require a heatsink.   To answer your problem, you first need to know the  power  dissipated by the component. To do this, it is a simple calculation of  P  =  IV . Thus, your power dissipated would be 4 mA * (12 V − 5 V) = 0.028 W which is equal to 28 mW.   Your next step is to look at the thermal properties of the component.   As you can see, the Max operating temperature is 125 °C.   Now you look at the Junction to Air Thermal Resistance. For the TO-220 package, it is 65 °C/W. Using this, you take your power value that you calculated earlier (0.028 W) and plug it into this equation. Doing that, you get: 65 °C/W * 0.028 W = 1.82 °C which means your 7805 will heat up by approximately 2 °C above the ambient temperature. If we assume you are working in an ambient of 25 °C, this means your component wil heat up to approximately 27 °C, this is well within the specified temperature range, and thus does not need a heatsink.  Following these steps will enable you to calculate similar things in the future.  ADDED  As Colin pointed out in his answer, the 78L05 might be cheaper for you, and is meant to be used in low current applications, as it has a max output current of 100 mA, which is still more than what you need.  Using the calculations from before, we can look at any datasheet for the component. I am using  THIS  one and we can find the thermal characteristics.   The TO-92 package is the 'Z' package which has a Junction to Air Thermal Resistance of 230 °C/W. We can now use this value in the previous equation: 230 °C/W * 0.028 W = 6.44 °C, which again, is more than fine for you to use without worrying.  EDIT:  I did forget to include the current of the 7805 IC itself. This was however, mentioned in the answer by Spehro Pefhany. However, if you remember to include the current of the IC you use, this method should enable you to calculate power and heat dissipation in future.","All commentators agree that the 7805 does not need a heatsink.

","If I lift weights and eat exactly my calorie requirements, what will happen to my body?","My answer would be that you do not give sufficient information on your diet to tell what will happen to your body either good or bad. Here is why:  I suspect that by controlling your calorie intake and exercising you want to achieve good figure and/or stay fit and healthy which is great.   Sure your body needs a daily source of energy which is provided by each of the main so called macronutrient classes: protein (4 calorie/g), fat (9 calorie/g) and carbohydrate (4 calorie/g). However keep in mind that calorie is simply a unit of energy which applies to food without specifying the actual nutrient class or nutrition value of it. Remember that a healthy diet should balance the relative amount of these macronutrients classes. Balance is needed to meet not only your energy needs for physical and brain activities but also to provide the right amount of constitutive molecular bricks to maintain your body healthy.   Also of high importance are classes of nutrient not directly related to energy. The micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals are required for your body to keep working properly. Remember the story of sailors sailing accross oceans for months suffering from atrocious tooth decay because of lack of vitamin. Vitamins and minerals though sold as chemical supplements occur naturally in meat, dairy products, vegetables and fruit.   An other advantage of consuming fruits and vegetables is they contain fibers. Fibers provide optimal bowel movement which in turn reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.  Other components present in food which have nothing to do with energy should be on the contrary avoided or their intake reasonabily limited. This is the case for salt which excess of consumption has been demonstrated to enhance the risk of heart desease. Moreover a list of undesired chemicals which are added or develop during the making of processed food are also regarded as unhealthy.  As a conclusion do not think of your body as only a calorie burner. Staying healthy and fit is at least in part a matter of nutrition which means you should actively choose the right food to eat. There is a lot of good books written by nutritionists to help you choose based on science.  To me eating healthy can also be guided by common sense. It is reasonable to think that the body we have inherited from our hunter-gatherer ancestors has not been shaped to eat extra sugar- and fat-rich chocolate bars off trees!","Commentators mostly agree that the OP didn’t give enough details about his lifestyle to give a good prediction.

If you know Vanish and X-Zone, and have the Gem Box (aka  Soul of Thamasa ), you can double-cast these two spells on them to kill them instantly.  The GBA version closes this loophole, but I don't know which version you're playing.  Brachiosaurs frequently drop Economizers (aka  Celestriads ), and you can sometimes steal Ribbons from them, which is an extra boon.  If you're trying to level your whole party, you can leave one high-level magic user in while you gain levels on the others, so that you can power level the rest of the active team.  The Brachiosaur casts very high level magic very quickly, so having appropriate speed enhancing relics is also a plus.

If you don't stretch the bird understanding of #6, it could have just been him realizing they were worried about something, and at sea, that would most likely be a big storm. He was also smelling the storm, probably due to slightly elevated levels of ozone.   Number 7 is a stretch, at least in our universe.  Zetsu doesn't exist, so we just have to accept on faith that the development of Zetsu by wild animals is a normal occurrence in the HxH universe. The same goes for the fast healing in #8 -- it is not ""real"" in our world, but in the HxH world it can be seen as very good DNA.  One scene does seem to demonstrate strength beyond ""highly athletic"".  At the end of the Exam Arc, Gon wakes up with his broken arm, learns what happened, and approaches Illumi with great anger.  He even uses his one good arm to lift Illumi above his head and break his arm through force of grip alone.  I think he could do this for two reasons.  First, his athleticism was being amplified by anger, boosting his strength.  This is a recognized phenomenon in our world, see the  Scientific American  article  When Fear Makes Us Superhuman . Also note that Illumi offered no resistance.  I think this was due to a combination of honest surprise and curiosity, a recognition that Gon was not a mortal threat, and the knowledge that Hisoka had already claimed Gon as his prey.  I therefor don't think Gon started out unnaturally tough.  He had a lot of good qualities from the beginning, including genetics and his friendly, outgoing demeanor.  These were not mystical or beyond understanding.  After the Hunter Exam arc, he does begin ongoing and consistent training and expansion of his abilities, so by the time he got to Heaven's Arena it would be fair to call him extremely tough and getting tougher every day.",Some commenters say that it was likely his rigorous background and training which necessitated him developing enhanced senses and great strength. Others suggest that he gained strength while fighting and killing wild animals. One commenter suggested that his strength may have been genetic due to his father's hunting abilities.,144,stack,1

Earlier on, she was seen creating the folding road, something that her mind was able to rationalize based on the creativity that is allowed within her sub-conscious.  Within Inception, a lot of activity within dreams is based on seeing things. Notice the feel and weight of a totem actually tells someone whether they are dreaming on or not. It would seem that this (weight, touch) is not quantifiable when dreaming.  So to test the limit, of an infinite loop of reflections, seeing that light can only travel so far, what is actually going on beyond the mirror? Is it an actual reflection or are they looking at something parallel with the current projections within the dreams thereby recursing the hallways out of existing material (notice one end of the walkway ends before placing the mirror and now it follows with a new continuous bikepath and you cannot actually see the end of it)  So two ways it could be interpreted (in my opinion), either   she broke the mirror herself to project the infinite walkway or  the mirror broke due to the limit of the creativity of her conscious not knowing what exactly is behind the mirror (playing with the concept of a world behind a mirror)   The second seems less likely as it would end up in a discontinuity of the movie environment and Cobb's reaction. My bet is on the first way, she was trying to create an infinite hallway and the break symbolizes either her own actions to break it or the limit of her conscious to what exactly would be an infinite hallway.","Two of the commenters think the scene is about the character exploring the ""limit of her mind"" or letting her ""play around in the world"" to see what she can manipulate.

Make Monday hate you"".    Well, it's not really a 'proposal' or offer. It's a motivational phrase intended to inspire the reader to have a better mood and be more productive.   It will be right or I not correctly think? ""Do not hate Monday. Hate the person who created the Monday"".   No, you're not thinking about it correctly. 1st, Monday is a name, so it doesn't have an article (""the"") unless you're talking about a very specific Monday. 2nd, the ancient astronomer who established the planetary hours is entirely irrelevant. People don't hate Monday as a day of the moon; people hate Monday as the return to the work week and its early wakeup time after the respite of a weekend. It's not Monday that's hateful; it's work itself but, that said, people don't usually want to be unemployed.  ""I hate Mondays"" is just a bit of self-indulgence (when spoken to yourself) or commiseration (when shared with others) that has become a pat cliché in most of the English-speaking world. So, getting back to the heart of your question:   "" Don't hate Monday. Make Monday hate you. ""   is the kind of thing a fairly clever manager would put up in a bathroom after a continuing education course on business psychology.  The idea  is to take an unhelpful and counterproductive tendency in the staff and, somehow, shunt it into a more productive direction. In this case, the lazy self-indulgence that ""I hate Mondays"" might condone is being converted into righteous anger against a personification. The idea is the worker, instead of slacking off, will focus on ""defeating"" her or his ""enemy"" Monday by working so hard that it's caught off-guard and worn out.  That's the idea, anyway.  The  actual  staff will just smirk a bit, finish their slash, and continue on with whatever they were planning on doing already.","Several commenters attempt to break down the phrase, explaining that it is a saying not really a proposal.

I've seen this kind of public pianos in hotels and in hospitals, and staff were always fine with people playing, at leats at daytime.  My main rationale for assuming that the piano may be used (which hasn't been mentioned in any of the answers so far) would be that as a hotel, they provide amenities such as a swimming pool and a tabletennis-table. Guests are allowed (or even supposed) to use those. It would be rather rude on the part of the hotel to favour sportive guests but deny musical guests the use of equivalent equipment.  And of course, by far not everyone who uses the sports facilities is proficient in them.  Personally, I love playing tabletennis, I just cannot stand the kill-joys who insist the ball must not touch the floor or the walls.  Hence, I'd see no reason why you'd even have to be confident to be playing well when you use such a public piano.

]",feeling when you've failed in your job,"Having been a teacher, I know the feeling of giving my students what I consider to be the perfect example to illustrate a concept I'm teaching, only to be met with stony faces or uncomprehending looks.  Competent teachers learn not to take that reaction personally; rather, they attempt to come up with another example that rings their students' bells or causes their light of understanding to turn on.  I am not saying that a teacher' failure to make a concept crystal clear is always, or even necessarily, the teacher's fault. Sometimes a significant portion of a class can be resistant to learning, inattentive, hindered by learning disabilities, and so on. Resourceful teachers, however, when facing uncomprehending looks, simply attack the concept from a different vantage point by using different examples and sometimes even wildly diverse and far-out methods.  The teacher who takes a temporary setback personally and with a deep sigh goes back to the line-upon-line, precept-upon-precept method of re-teaching foundational facts is likely experiencing a form of  cognitive dissonance , a concept elucidated by  Dr. Leon Festinger  years ago and elaborated by countless theoreticians and social psychologists ever since the theory burst on the scene.  In essence, cognitive dissonance arises in a person when he fails to experience an expected outcome. Consequently, his dis-ease triggers disappointment, ambivalence, embarrassment, frustration, discomfort and even anger.  Put differently, cognitive dissonance rears its head when a person entertains two conflicting ideas or concepts in his or her mind at the same time, and then through a process of choosing one idea in preference to the other idea attempts to get rid of the dissonance. Some people are more immune to cognitive dissonance than others, but it is most likely a universal human experience.  A teacher who sees herself as a really good teacher may, upon experiencing the phenomenon you describe in your question, begin to question her teaching ability, asking such questions as    Am I really as good as I think I am?   Am I in the right profession?   What am I doing wrong, such that the whole class doesn't seem to ""get it""?     Another tack might be to cast blame on the students and resolve the dis-ease she feels by saying such things as    This class is simply not very bright.   This class is not willing to learn.   These students are apathetic.     The truly competent teacher, on the other hand, engages neither in self-doubt nor the blame-game; rather, he regroups with his self-concept intact and attacks the problem as he believes a good teacher would by inventing new examples, trying different teaching methods, and forging ahead despite a temporary setback.  The former teacher is tempted to ""cut her losses"" and give up. The latter teacher takes his students' failure to understand as a challenge for him to step up his game.  Disappointment itself is a universal human experience and emotion. Some people deal with it better than others. Some folks do not even feel disappointment until they reach a certain fairly high threshold, as in the case of a teacher who has used  numerous  examples (not just one) to elucidate a concept for her students, only to be confronted with the furrowed brows of incomprehension.  In summary, I think cognitive dissonance describes aptly the phenomenon you describe in your question. How a teacher experiences and deals with the frustration and disappointment triggered by an apparent failure to teach (or a failure of students to learn) depends a great deal on her tenacity, flexibility,  resourcefulness, and good humor, all of which keep a temporary setback in the learning process in perspective by not allowing it to define either her or her students.","Some commenters come up with several possibilities focused on the emotions the teacher would feel in this situation, such as crestfallen, frustration, incompetent, and exasperated.

Once you have the station set up, you are ready to start breading.  Take your chicken pieces and dip in the water, then place them in the flour.  Remove from the flour and shake the excess off the chicken (preferably back into the flour basin). Then re-dip into the water, straight up and down to ensure very little breading loss.

They both include clear explanations and some very good examples.  It strikes me that if you already know these things and you are still struggling with writing long sentences, then perhaps you need to look deeper into the reasons why you tend to write short sentences. Is it perhaps that your sentences are reflecting your thought processes? Alternatively, is it possible that you have been taught that short sentences in writing are a good thing and that, on some level, you are reluctant to break free from that early conditioning?  I notice that you use several short sentences in your question (this being the only sample of your writing that I have) and that it would have been possible for you to have joined them into longer sentences. Maybe you can spend a few minutes asking yourself why you chose to chop your question into short segments. I feel that you would benefit from exploring this aspect.

In Thailand, ATMs give you a better exchange rate than changing cash, especially for less-popular currencies like NZD. However, you need to be aware of the fees your home bank may charge (fixed fee + percent commission). On top of this, almost all ATMs in Thailand charge an additional 150 THB fee for international transactions, so it's better to withdraw larger amounts. Citibank ATMs near Asoke/Sukhumwit BTS Skytrain station do not charge the 150 baht fee (as of Jan 2012).   Second best is probably changing cash to THB in Thailand. Rates at the Bangkok airport are reasonable, but some places in the city offer better rates.   Exchange rates for THB in your home country are probably significantly worse than in Thailand (due to currency export controls).",Commenters recommend using airport ATMs as their fees are less than other ATM's. Several commenters confirm that there are plenty ATMs in Bangkok's airport. Others recommended withdrawing in as large amounts as possible to avoid fees.

The answer is: No. There is no prescription of nutrients in Islam, one can even be a vegan.  Is is must to offer cow as ritual sacrifice? The answer is: No. Camels, water buffaloes, sheep or goats can do.  However, the situation in India has a socio-political and economic context and history, in addition to the religious questions.  Political Context   Muslims have lived in India for over a thousand years, enjoying religious freedom though often as the ruling minority.  India is constitutionally secular and up until the current regime, with its unprecedented support of Hindu fundamentalism, there were not Muslims killed for the very act of eating beef. Even in the state of Gujrat, famous for massacre of Muslims, cow eating was not a mortal sin. Cow slaughter was not unprecedented in the life of an ordinary Indian Muslim.   Economic Context   Cows are - arguably - the second most preferred animals for ritual sacrifice in the subcontinent and with growing inflation more and more people are finding hard to afford small animals like sheep and goat. Every year there are more people vouching for shared ritual sacrifice (7 shares per animal) of larger animals only because of its affordability.

The  religious  question before Indian Muslims is not whether they can avoid cows but rather how to deal politically, as a minority community, in a secular country when your tradition is challenged, when it had been in practice for centuries. Admittedly, there exists no canonical  Fiqh of politics for a Muslim minority  that would serve as a guideline for the community of Muslims in India, which is precisely why there are varied reactions to it. Had there been such a Fiqh it would have answered questions like ""Should such a law be accepted?"" ""Should it be challenged in a court of law?"" ""Should there be civil disobedience and under what circumstances?"" and so on.

It's a funny way of looking at  Dunbar's number , which is the numerical limit of those relationships. I've heard it a lot in IT-related psychological circles lately, and I see no limit to the term's uptake.

]","What's the difference between ""con brio"" and ""con fuoco""?","Italian here, with a little background in music theory.The words have very different meanings; especially the word ""brio"" I see being misinterpreted.  ""Brio"" means light-headed happiness. Think more of an elegant version of ""allegro"". I would play it by letting the fingers fly on the keyboard. (Note that allegro may also indicate how fast to play it: lentissimo < lento < allegro < presto < veloce < velocissimo)  ""Fuoco"" literally may mean fire, but in this case it is intended as ""with passion"". I would play it by smashing the notes, especially in long note and main passages.  While I'm here I also want to answer some comments:""Allegro con brio"" means happy, but the brio part focuses on the distracted nature of happiness, like you are casually playing the music just because you like it.  ""Presto con fuoco"" means fast with passion; like you are going to your crush and she is home alone.

Looking at the wikipedia  page on mass nouns , the characteristics of mass nouns include:   They can be quantified by  some  and  much :   some water; much water  some furniture; much furniture  some trouble; much trouble   But this does not apply to  Man , because you cannot say   *some Man; *much Man   They have cumulative reference. That means, very roughly, that if you add or take away a portion of what the noun refers to, then you still have something that you can still use the same noun for: if I take  water , and add  water  to it, then I still have  water , whereas if I took  a pencil  and added  a pencil  to it, I would no longer have  a pencil  but  pencils :   adding water to water gives water  adding furniture to furniture leaves furniture (and a messy house)  adding trouble to trouble leaves trouble (and a stressful life)   and similarly one can apply restrictions and end up with the same noun:   the water that is in this cup is water  the furniture that is in my kitchen is furniture  the trouble that I caused by myself is trouble   This does not apply to  Man , because it always refers to the  entire  of mankind - if one were to say   The man that lives in Europe is Man   then (a) the first  man  is used differently (using the definite article to refer to a typical instance), and (b) the sentence is false, because the final  Man  is understood to refer to to mankind as a whole.   So... if it's not a mass noun, then what is it? I have to confess I'm not 100% positive of this (and don't have easy access to  CGEL  to check), but I would say that this a usage similar to using a definite singular to refer to an entire class ( The blue whale can grow to up to 30m in length ), but turning the noun into a proper noun due to familiarity. This latter explains why, in contrast to that usage, there is no need for a definite article, and also the the common practice of capitalising the first letter.
