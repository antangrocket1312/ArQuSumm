How can I avoid rakk attacks?,"['Rakk, those bat-like things that serve pain from above, seem to have attacks that are impossible to avoid.  Even if I jump at the last second, they still end up somehow scoring a hit on me.  Is there a way to dodge their attacks?', '', '', 'You are playing Borderlands 2, not Hitman: Absolution, last I checked.  Nothing in Borderlands 2 should scream STEALTH, rather, it should scream, SHOOT!  Shotguns work great against rakk, as the spread of the pellets allows for almost insta-kills at close range.  Trying to use weapons that have higher spreads should allow you to shred through rakk quickly.  Avoid using snipers or rocket launchers; rakk move fast, and can easily dodge your attacks.  That said, if you really want to dodge a rakk attack, try strafing to the side and jumping.  That usually makes them miss.', '', '', '', '', ""Rakk always attack in  a straight line. Pay attention to the mini-map to see where they are in relation to you, then rotate to face their attack. Any rapid-firing weapon should be sufficient to take them down. I've successfully used shotguns, assault rifles, and pistols (both repeaters and revolvers).  A well-timed melee attack will also take them down.  If none of these work, you can always equip a shield that provides elemental damage (such as a  Maliwan Spike shield ). When the rakk hits you, it takes damage, and usually enough to kill it."", '', '', ""Equip a spike shield which damages all melee attackers, and the Rakks will kill themself when they attack you. Rakks have quite low HP, so when you have a good shield and they aren't too high-level, their first attack will be their last one."", '', '', 'Presuming you actually want to  avoid  them...   In general order of priority...   Some rakk flocks are just hanging around, especially early on. If you don\'t shoot at them, they won\'t attack. (Later-game flocks seem to be a lot more aggressive though.)   And that\'s roughly the limit of how to not poke the bear, so to speak. Next up is ""how not to get hit while killing them"".   if you can get to somewhere with overhead cover, that will often prevent them from getting an attack run in.  Less effective but still useful is to get against a wall - not only does it prevent the attacks from that side, the rakks tend to get hung up on the wall trying to finish their swoop, which makes them easy targets.  If you\'re in open space, getting a vehicle makes life easier (both because you have infinite ammo and a bigger stack of health). I\'d recommend the machine gun turret.   In all those cases (and the worst-case ""stuck in the open with no vehicle""), you want a shotgun, SMG, or assault rifle, watch your minimap to see where they\'re coming from, and pour fire downrange. Rakks attack straight-line and don\'t have huge health bars, so it\'s fairly easy to drop one.', '', '', ""The strategy that works best for me is to run backwards while aiming to the entire flock. They tend to fly in a line so you'll have a good angle to shoot one after another as they fall.   Some rapid fire weapon (i.e. any good Vladof gun) should dispose of them easily. If they get close, switch to a shotgun. Rather than dodging, don't give them the chance to approach you.  This is quite class-agnostic. There might be a better option based on your character class AND skills."", '']","Commentators agree that the Rakk are predictable and can be taken on pretty easily. Most commentators advise using a rapid-fire weapon or one with a good spread, such as a shotgun.

"When, if ever, are dried herbs preferable to fresh herbs?","['Sometimes I see a recipe call for dried herbs. If I have access to fresh herbs, should I go for fresh herbs instead? Is there any benefit in using dried herbs with some recipes?', '', '', ""Dry rubs are one case that I can think of where dry is specifically necessary, so you can grind them up properly.  The main advantage to dry herbs is that they're available year round.  When you're dealing with winter dishes, dry herbs would've been the norm to have used at that time.  If you are going to substitute, you'll need to add more (typically about 3x as much, as the dry is usually more concentrated), and you'll want to add it late in the cooking process, while dry herbs are usually added early.  One exception to the rule is bay leaves -- you'll still need to add them early, and you'll want to reduce the number."", '', '', 'Certain herbs are very mild when fresh and do not develop their full smell and flavour until dried; e.g. bayleaf, oregano.  Fresh herbs generally have short storage times. When substituting you typically need to add much more of the herb, as drying shrinks it concentrating the flavour.', '', '', '', '', ""I tend to go fresh whenever possible.   Some useful tips:   When using dried, crush them first. I typically smash them with my thumb a few times into the palm of my other hand. This helps release the essential oils in the dried herbs.  When using fresh in place of dried use slightly more. I'm not an herb-measurer, I eyeball, but I always use roughly 25% more. The fresh herbs tend to have a fresher, yet milder flavor. They also give up their essential oils much easier than dried, so the oils can evaporate and cook away quicker.  When using fresh in place of dried, add later in the cooking process if possible. This depends a lot on which herbs in particular. The reason behind this is similar to the previous tip, fresh herbs are tenderer and can do a flavor dump very early in the process."", '', '', 'There is no one rule that holds all when it comes to dry/fresh herbs. There is so much variation between herbs in how they respond to the drying process. Basil, for instance, loses most of it intense flavor in the drying process. As pointed out to some others most kinds of oregano have a very different flavour when dried. Rosemary on the other hand maintains its flavour very well when dried. My advice is to make the decision on a herb by herb basis.   The above refers to regular drying. Note that freeze drying often maintains flavours of the fresh herb more. It’s however not common to find freeze dried herbs in regular shops.', '', '', ""Heating herbs can discolor them - if you've seen someone put fresh basil on a pizza before baking it, you can observe what happens.  Same goes for sauces like tomato sauce that simmer for hours.  If you want the flavor to infuse into the dish you will need to use dried.  In addition, fresh herb flavor is more delicate.  If you need to supercharge a dish but don't want to change the color, use dried herbs."", '', '', ""Dry rubs are a great use  for dried herbs, but  fresh can be pureed to a paste  and used under the skin, so they can be useful for outer seasoning, too.  Choosing one or the other can  depend on how long  a dish is cooking.  Dried herbs take a while to impart flavor  so they're mostly useful for longer cooking dishes. Also, getting a piece of dried herb that  hasn't had time to hydrate & soften can be really offputting  to eat! Often, however,  I use both- dried or sturdier herbs at the beginning & fresher/more tender herbs at the end  when the dish is pulled off the heat.

Basically: Balance the circle (pot) so that the neck naturally hangs where you need it.

On the other hand, the underlying idea of blood-status is that some people diluted their pure wizard blood with Muggle blood. If your blood is merely diluted then you’re a Half-Blood, but if you’re blood is entirely Muggle then you’re a Mudblood. If all four of your grandparents are Muggles then your parents likely had no wizard blood.

"When baking, is it better to use a gas or electric oven?","[""I'm looking for an oven and wanted to know if there is any difference between a gas or electric oven when it comes to baking things like cakes, biscuits and scones?"", '', '', '', ""For baking cakes and breads it is important to control the humidity in the oven. In early stages of baking one typically needs the humidity to remain in the baking chamber, which is hard to do with a gas oven.  Two of the bakeries near my house use electric ovens with brick lined baking chambers; the other uses gas.   Expansion  Gas and electric ovens can be built to bake the same way if cost is not an issue.  Most home gas ovens will circulate the combustion products (mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide) in the cooking chamber.  As the flames burn, combustion products need to be vented out of the baking chamber.  Electric ovens also need vents in the baking chamber to help maintain the pressure as the air inside expands.  Steam is essential in the initial stages of baking for good crust formation in breads and crack-free cake surfaces. The oven cavity can hold much more steam than released from the gas combustion and it is my inference that the steam content of an electric oven will be higher  (I cannot find published steam measurements inside ovens). After the dough expansion, the vapor coming off of the dough or batter needs to removed quickly for browning and for the inside to cook well.  The constant flow in a gas oven makes it better at that. In an electric oven a peep or two during the last baking stages will handle excess moisture.   Two bakeries near my house use electric ovens, the other, which makes excellent French baguettes, uses a gas oven.  The baker there has had both electric and gas ovens and he prefers the caramelization of the gas oven.

As a native English speaker, it never occurred to me that the common phrase ""let go of me"" was so grammatically awkward (by modern standards, anyway). It probably reflects the speech patterns that were common at the time of its origin, which I\'m guessing is way back in ye olde days. I can almost make sense of it if I close my eyes and imagine the dialog that might ensue if Shakespeare rudely grabbed someone by the wrist...   Someone:  ""LET GO!""  Shakespeare:  ""Would that I possessed the knowledge to fulfill thy command, sir. Yet verily thou hast failed to nameth yon object whereupon I am to act. Prithee tell,  of what  dost thou speaketh?""  Someone:  ""\'Tis  of me  that I speaketh! LET GO  OF ME !""

Apologies to anyone who hasn\'t been exposed to the weird medieval English spoken in  Shakespeare \'s plays-- but hey, my English teachers made me read it, so....  Anyway, back on topic. I\'m not entirely sure that there are any literal differences in meaning between the two phrases in question (that is, differences that could be deduced entirely through analysis of grammar and vocabulary, without taking common usage into consideration) although it\'s clear that they have come to mean two different things to modern English speakers.  In my mind, the command ""Let go of me"" applies to a subset of the situations in which the command ""Let me go"" could be used-- specifically, to those situations in which the entity being given the command is physically grasping the command giver. ""Let me go"" would work equally well in those situations, but it would also work in almost any situation in which the command giver\'s freedom of movement is being restricted somehow by the command receiver.  The phrase ""let go me"" would definitely be considered incorrect grammar, even though it appears to contain all of the information necessary to convey the intended meaning. So, why do we need the ""of""? Consider the phrase ""let go, me!"" That is (arguably) a grammatically-correct way of commanding oneself (or someone named Me) to let go, without identifying the object that is to be let go. The phrase ""let go  of  me,"" on the other hand, identifies the object that is to be acted upon rather than the entity that is to perform the action. So, maybe that\'s the purpose of the word ""of"", then-- to indicate that we\'re referring to the object and not the actor. Except...  Now consider the phrase ""release me!"" It is correct English, even without the ""of"". In fact, inserting an ""of"" would make it incorrect. Yet, somehow the native English speaker understands that it is the object, and not the actor, being referenced. In this case, English follows the exact same grammar rules as the OP\'s language-- rules that in the previous paragraph were deemed incorrect.  Ultimately, I\'m forced to conclude that the phrase ""let go of me"" is yet another ""special case"" in a language which, I\'ve been told, is largely comprised of special cases. In general, the word ""of"" means the same thing as the word ""about"", so mentally substituting that word (or an equivalent word in your language) may help with comprehension. Unfortunately, I\'m not aware of any general rule that you can use to determine whether the word ""of"" should or shouldn\'t be included in a particular sentence.', '', '', '', ""Let go of me means for instance if you're grabbing someone's arm and they wish to be released from your catch, whereas let me go may mean allow me to disappear, possibly from your life forever."", '']","Commentators generally agree that “let go of me” refers to physical grasping instead of general imprisonment and that it is more commanding.

We sat down with him and explained the whole thing, and how he was now a big boy and he was ready to use the potty. At first it was very scary for him. Sitting was fun, we read him a story or showed him a video from Elmo, and he was very happy, but when he felt he was about to pee, he started yelling a lot, as if it was a bad thing. We faced the same situation on a previous attempt and we quit trying then. But know we kept on trying, we told him everything was going to be alright and it was OK to pee in the potty.

How do inversions of extended chords work?,"['I am trying to understand what is the main difference between inversions and voicings, The way I see it is that the inversion will establish the lowest note on a chord, while the voicing is the specific arrangement of harmonics used when playing that chord.  But this becomes blurry in my mind when using extended chords. Can someone please explain how inversions work with extended chords?', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""One just gets more inversions. With  7th chords, there are 4 inversions; any note can be in the bass. Inversion of chords does not specify the disposition of upper voices (in general.) There is an exception in that 9th chords almost always have the 9th above the root. For chords with more than 5 tones, it's not always the case that the object is a chord; it could be a simpler chord with non-chord tones added (not uncommon)."", '', '', ""In theory, inverting an extended chord works the same as inverting a simple triad, except that more inversions are possible.  In practice, however, notes are usually omitted from extended chords to avoid jarring dissonances, so  not all of the inversions are seen in the wild .  13th chords are usually in root position because their inversions are academic.Because all 7 notes of the scale are present in a 13th chord (at least in theory),  inverting it has the effect of turning it into a different 13th chord .  To touch on the distinction between  inversion  and  voicing :  A chord's  inversion  will only tell you which note is in the bass.  It doesn't say anything else about it.  A chord's  voicing  is a more complete picture that would include the inversion as well as other characteristics.  The term  voicing  is often used in the context of a particular instrument, e.g. piano voicings or guitar voicings, and therefore include a consideration of what is idiomatic for that instrument.  Other characteristics which factor into the voicing are (not necessarily exhaustive):   which order (top to bottom) do the notes appear in?  what is the spacing between the notes?  which notes (if any) have been omitted?  which notes (if any) have been doubled?  in ensemble settings, which instruments are playing which notes in which registers? (i.e. orchestration)"", '', '', 'The way I see it is that the inversion will establish the lowest note on a chord, while the voicing is the specific arangement of harmonics used when playing that chord.   That right.   But this becomes blurry in my mind when using extended chords.   Let\'s first point out that seventh chords can put any chord tone into the bass including the seventh. Ex.  C: V4/2  would be  F G B D  with the seventh in the bass, typically resolving down to the third of the tonic chord in  I6 . Without question that is totally conventional harmony.  Now let\'s consider extensions to be the intervals high than the seventh: ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths. The seventh should be present with those extensions so they aren\'t mixed up with simple intervals  add2 ,  sus4 ,  add6 , etc.  The conventional treatment would be to place the extensions above the chord root. (Walter Piston\'s  Harmony  is my source for that point. His text is concern with roughly Bach to Brahms with later Romantics like Grieg and Dvorak, so fairly conservative.) I think the rationale is that putting the extensions in the bass can give the impression of other chords with some added non-chord tones or their own extensions!  Consider a basic  G7  and the extensions above. Put the ninth in the bass and it sounds like an  Am9  on the bottom with two appoggiaturas, put the eleventh in the bass and it sounds like a  Cmaj9 , put the thirteenth in the bass and it sounds like an  Em7  with a  b9  or a non-chord tone of some kind.  So for all practical purposes, conventional handling sets the inversion ""limit"" at third inversion. And for clarity\'s sake put the extensions above the root, but you probably have a lot of freedom with the specifics of the voices above the root.', '', '', ""Exactly the same way as with simple chords, just more possible inversions.  Having said that, anything beyond the 7th in a 'pile-of-thirds' type extended chord is almost always going to be in the upper structure, not as the bass note.  C, C/E, C/G, C/B♭ (call it C7/B♭ if you like) are commonplace.   C9/D, C7(#11)/F# and C13/A are less likely.  If you're thinking in guitar terms, and there's a bass player, there may be little point it thinking of 'inversions' in what YOU play, just 'voicings'. It doesn't matter so much whether you're playing C E G, E G C, G C E or an open voicing if the bass is hitting (say) an E.   Whatever YOU do, musically it's a first inversion."", '', '', ""There is some crossover. Inversions (and root position) will tell what note is at the bottom - in C major triad, C as bass will be root, E as bass will be 1st inversion, and G as bass will be 2nd inversion. It matters not which order the other two are, above the lowest note.  The more notes added to that triad (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, 13ths, and their ♭/♯ alterations), the more  inversions  there can be. Obviously, with a 5 note chord, there are 5 different choices for which note is at the bottom. Again, order of other notes (or even lack of them) won't affect the naming of that inversion. Some may not sound good - but that's a different kettle of fish!  Voicings - open or closed? Closed voicings occur when each and every note is as close to the next (up and down) that it can be. Open voicings use whatever notes are appropriate, but will not use every consecutive note from that chord. All voicings are subject to root or inversions. They can have any of the approriate notes, in any order. They can double or treble certain notes. On guitar, it's common on chords such as open E to play  three  root notes.  So, whilst being closely related, they're not the same, although they do both contribute to information about a chord, they are not synonymous. Every voicing will also have a label for its inversion, but an inversion tells us little about the voicing.  Check out  slash chords ,  drop voicing .

Is UL approval required on all items sold in the USA,"['I have a spray tan machine which I wish to sell in the USA.  I have had the machine tested by a CE test house.

Check with the test house that did your CE approval, if they are big enough they may also grant NRTL marks (we use TUV Rheinland).  Note that not using UL or CSA may cause problems in some jurisdictions that are old fashioned.  We have a $4.5M medical device and the City of Baltimore wanted UL, CSA or MET Labs so we gave MET Labs the TUV test reports and a check for a few thousand dollars and they gave us an approval.  UL is a pain to work with, I would go with CSA before UL (even though CSA is Canadian they can grant US NRTL marks in general).

So in that situation, editing on cans was always fine - and indeed often easier to spot little issues like clicks. The flipside is that you can start worrying about things that in the larger scale of the project don't really matter, and that slows you down. When you have 45.000 lines of dialogue to edit, you don't want to slow down, as you can imagine.

Can rock salt be used for sewer maintenance?,"['I have read that flushing a glass full of rock salt down your toilet every month is good practice if you have a cast iron sewer line. Reason being is that the salt will kill off any tree roots in the pipe and also prevent more roots from coming in and causing blockage. Is anyone currently doing this and if so how has it worked for you?', '', '', 'I was able to find a reference to this in chapter 22 of  The Complete Idiot\'s Guide to Household Solutions .     Though honestly, I\'ve never heard of this approach until now. I\'m no expert on the corrosiveness of salt, but I would imagine the levels of salt in the sewer would not be high enough to rust the pipe. I\'m also skeptical that the salt levels would be high enough to completely kill and prevent the roots. While I wouldn\'t recommend pouring a bag for rock salt down the drain, a handful once or twice a month will probably not hurt the pipe.  There are other tried and true methods to remove roots from sewer lines.  Mechanincal  Augers  Augers can be used to effectively remove roots from a sewer line, by cutting the roots out. This is not likely a solution for a DIYer, since it involves expensive specialty tools.  This method will not prevent roots from growing back into the sewer.  Hydrojetters  A hydrojetter is essentially a power washer with a rotating mechanical ""sweeper"", that is designed to be fed into the sewer line and blast and sweep roots away. Again, this is not likely a DIY option and does not prevent the roots from regrowing.  Digging  In some cases roots may have caused too much damage to the sewer line, and the only option available is to dig the line up and replace it. This can be very expensive, and will almost certainly not be a DIY project.  Chemical  Contact Herbicides  Contact herbicides are chemicals that will kill the roots, and in some cases prevent them from regrowing.  These are typically a more DIY friendly option, and can be found as simple ""pour down"" solutions.  Contact herbicides can include:   Bensulide  Copper Sulfide  Dichlobanil  Dinoseb  Metham sodium  Paraquat  Potasium Hydroxide  Sulfamic Acid  Trifluralin   A common product recommended by plumbers is  RootX . This is a herbicide in a foaming carrying agent, that allows the herbicide to reach roots at the top of the pipe.  RootX uses Dichlobenil, and is non-caustic, non-fumigating, and non-systemic. Unfortunately, it\'s not readily available to homeowners, so you\'ll likely have to contact a plumber for this treatment.  Searching around, I stumbled upon a product similar to RootX that is available to homeowners.  Roebic® Foaming Root Killer  is available at  Lowes  for about $20.00. It foams up, and uses dichlobenil as the herbicide just like RootX.

Charles Kingsley used one old  British form in Westward Ho! in 1855: “there are more ways of killing  a cat than choking it with cream”. Other versions include “there are  more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with butter”, and “there  are more ways of killing a dog than choking him with pudding”.

The OC Bible took years and years to complete and a number of the members of the C.E.T. needed to be replaced during its compilation as they died of various causes.

In chemistry, the term \' chiral \' (stemming from the greek word for hand) describes the property of not overlapping with one\'s mirror image. Left and right hands are chiral because they are mirror images of each other, but however you reorient them, you will not be able to make them overlap. Conversely an object such as a chair can be reoriented such that it is indistinguishable from its mirror image, and therefore is achiral.

Dissymmetrical  objects lack a particular element of symmetry called an \'axis of improper rotation\', but they may or may not have other elements of symmetry.

Though it’s not clear what either Crabbe’s or Goyle’s jobs were, or even if they had joined or were independently wealthy, Crabbe can be presumed to have a respectable position. Lucius Malfoy was willing to both associate with him himself, and let his son associate with and befriend Crabbe’s son before they began attending Hogwarts. This implies Crabbe likely didn’t have a ‘lower class’ job.   In childhood, Draco associated mainly with the pure-blood children of his father’s ex-Death Eater cronies, and therefore arrived at Hogwarts with a small gang of friends already made, including Theodore Nott and Vincent Crabbe.  - Draco Malfoy (Pottermore)   Though Goyle’s son only met Draco at Hogwarts, he likely did too, since it’s unlikely that Draco would choose to befriend someone that his father would disapprove of.   It was, therefore, in the knowledge that he was doing nothing of which his father would disapprove, and in the hope that he might be able to relay some interesting news home, that Draco Malfoy offered Harry Potter his hand when he realised who he was on the Hogwarts Express.  - Draco Malfoy (Pottermore)   Since Draco very heavily patterned himself after his father, it’s unlikely he’d do something if he thought his father wouldn’t have wanted him to, so he probably wouldn’t choose to befriend someone below his status. Because of this, it’s likely that Goyle also didn’t have a ‘lower-class’ job.   Much of Draco’s behaviour at school was modelled on the most impressive person he knew – his father – and he faithfully copied Lucius’s cold and contemptuous manner to everyone outside his inner circle. Having recruited a second henchman (Crabbe being already in position pre-Hogwarts) on the train to school, the less physically imposing Malfoy used Crabbe and Goyle as a combination of henchman and bodyguard throughout his six years of school life.  - Draco Malfoy (Pottermore)   It’s not said exactly what either of their jobs were, but because of the Malfoys’ willingness to associate with them, they can be presumed not to have been below a certain social status.', '']","Several of the commenters think that Crabbe Sr and Goyle Sr must have come from wealthy families and did not need to have jobs.

What is the silver strip behind crystal in the PCB?,"['Consider:   I came across a PCB, and I found a silver strip behind the crystal. What is that strip? Has anyone used it?', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""Here's a picture to help you understand better. The crystal's case can be soldered onto boards to secure them."", '', '', ""I wish I could find an image of this, but that is a ground pad.  When mounting larger crystals, like the one shown in Peter's answer, it is normal to bend the leads so the can is laid flat on the board to limit the height of the board envelope. (Note it does little with the crystal shown in your image.)  Unfortunately, when mounted flat in that position the thing is rather easy to move and will catch on things and bend up, eventually breaking the leads in extreme circumstances. The thing will also vibrate in a mechanically noisy environment.  As such it needs to be tied down.  Note the two holes on either sides of the pad. It is common to see a strap, made of an offcut of an axial component lead, bent to fit over the crystal and soldered into those holes with a further dab of solder where the strap touches the case on top to form a good ground for the case. Other times you may see a single hole at the top of the crystal for a single wire post or hook instead.   The reason for the big pad itself is a little less obvious than it first appears. The can on crystals is normally isolated from the pins, and as such it is prudent to solder the case down to a ground pad. (Why they don't have three pins to make it easy to ground the case has always eluded me...)  However, why the pad needs to be as large as the can is not so clear.  Crystals don't get hot so it is not for heat-sink reasons, and since the crystal is already enclosed in its own little Faraday cage, when grounded, E.M. radiation reasons don't make much sense either.  Personally, I think the large pad is more to prevent you from running other signals under the crystal. Doing so with a poorly grounded can could interfere with the crystal oscillations."", '', '', ""It's a solder pad for a full-size (HC-49/U) crystal, for mechanical purposes. Clearly it has no use when a small (HC-49/US) crystal such as the one in the photograph is used."", '', '', '', '', ""It'd be used to horizontally mount a larger crystal such as the following HC-49. The two through-hole pads either side are often used along with some wire to secure them in place, plus you may also find those connected to ground to provide some additional shielding."", '', '', '', '', ""The white silver pad is for bending the crystal to side and soldering the same so that it also gets grounded.  Now there are multiple reasons that I have come across, some of which are:   The metal can enclosing the crystal acts as a  Leyden jar  and an effective RF shield. There is little or no reason it needs to be grounded.The main reason the case is sometimes soldered is for mechanical stability.  Precaution to prevent oscillations at the wrong frequency.  If you're going to be touching the crystal case a lot, then you may want to ground it, so that the clock is solid even though you touch it. We're using 24\xa0MHz crystals in one application and if you get your finger within 1/4 inch (6\xa0mm) of the can the crystal speed will change. So we ground them to keep them stable. Once in production, no one will be touching it, so no grounding after we get done with the design/programming cycle.

Can I access USB using hyperterminal, teraterm, minicom, etc or do I need some other software?  Any other considerations?   Thanks.', '', '', '', '', 'A1: By far the quickest and easiest method, and possibly the equal best, is to buy an existing USB to serial converter. I\'ve seen these advertised on ebay for under $5 and those were probably not the cheapest. Here are  ebay\'s listings of USB to RS232 converters  - well worth looking at to see the range available (and prices).   Wow! -  here is one for $US3 including shipping to the US from Hong Kong .   OK - checks - you\'re in Mumbai, India - checks - $US1.99 to India, free shipping!. You won\'t build one for that little - probably by a factor of 10 to 20!  Here are  a few dozen photos and links to serial to USB converers  - hover over the pictures for more information (on the page linked to above -  not  on the picture below) - click to go to the related site. A few examples - lots of choice !!! -    You can build your own using any of several available custom ICs created for this purpose - but doing that will cost you more than buying a prebuilt one.  A market leader but not the only source of ICs is  FTDI corp who make these products .  A2. The most common units (usually a ""cable"" that plugs into a USB port) appear to a PC as a standard serial ""comms port"". They work across a range of baud rates. May be manufacturer dependant. Will be settable in software.   A3: As above - appears as a standard serial port.   A4: Some manufacturers peripherals do strange things and may not work for all converters. For example the PIC based PICAxe system uses a programming protocol that sends all data to and fro using RS232 ""break signals"". ie they do not use the data lines for information transfer. Some converters do not support the break signal.     You will need to know if your equipment is grossly non standard. If it is, some converters may work with it.  .', '', '', '4. Any other considerations?  Yes.  Classic serial ports are ordinarily byte-oriented, ie, one character at a time with quite low latency.  USB is inherently packet-oriented, with comparably high-latency.  In other words, USB is great for moving a lot of data at once, but it\'s actually slower at moving tiny amounts of data.  If you try to move a lot of data in tiny pieces with USB, you lose -  badly .  For just typing on a terminal program talking to a modem or an embedded device, or even uploading files, etc, this is really not a problem, because single doses of the latency are small in human terms, and the USB can easily move blocks of data fast enough keep up with any serial baud rate.  But other protocols which depend on constant back-and-forth of short messages or single characters between a computer and a serial peripheral can slow to a crawl (or even mis-operate) when used with a usb-serial converter.  If a computer does something like send a single character, and wait for the peripheral to respond before sending then next, then the character rate is determined by the latency for two entire usb packets - one to send a single character, and one to receive one (it may even be worse - the receive might at the lowest level involve poling).  In today\'s world where USB-serial converters are as or more common than real serial ports, its important to design protocols so that you can send out a lot of data, before needing to wait for a reply.  With legacy systems, you may get lucky and find it works fine, it may work but slowly, or it may not work reliably at all.  And even within a given protocol, peripheral, computer, and operating system driver, the design of the client software matters.  I once encountered a piece of management software for an embedded device which had been written and tested by a contractor using a real serial port.  It turned out to use some variation of .NET serial calls that turned out to be ""watch the results crawl in"" slow on a laptop with a usb-serial converter.  My own previous simple win32 management tool for that device ran without apparently delay on the same laptop with the same converter.  Perhaps I wrote better code, but given that the converter was my ordinary test environment, if there had been a similar problem with my code, I would have been lucky enough to find it while there was still time to fix the problem.

Floating glove scene in Man of Steel. What does it mean?,"['In the movie Man of Steel, General Zod and Superman fought in an unfinished building. In that scene, General Zod mentioned that ""trained all his life to master his senses"" and then removed his armor by flexing his body.  I can\'t help but to notice that when he has removed his armor, one his glove was floating while other parts of his armor fell onto the ground as he levitates. What does this mean and what is the significance of it?', '', '', '', 'The Power of Imagery  Warning: This answer is about the artistic reason(s) for the levitating glove, not scientific reasons .  If you\'re into such things,  Man of Steel  is rich with imagery and symbolism. Sometimes it\'s conspicuous, such as when Clark is at a church and the camera pauses ever so briefly with an anguished Clark in front of a crucified Christ. Sometimes it\'s a lot more subtle, such as when Jor-El\'s image is directing Clark and Lois on the ship, and it\'s all done with classical poses similar to those in Greco-Roman statues: This totally jibes with Kryptonian society in the movie being based heavily on Plato\'s ""Republic."" Another subtle one is the ""baptism"" of Clark when he goes through a trial by fire and ends up immersed in the ocean.  Anyways, as far as  imagery  goes, a gauntlet is a symbol of power. (side note: the difference between a glove and, more specifically, a gauntlet is, generally speaking, that a gauntlet is used in battle/war). Notice that it\'s not just the case that the viewer can see a gauntlet floating---it\'s actually the case that the glove is foregrounded in a shot, taking up almost the entire frame, and the camera ever so subtly pauses there for  just  a brief moment.  So I would suggest that scene may have been less about a scientific reason and more about an artistic and symbolic message. Zod has just expressed his view that, essentially, might-makes-right when it comes to protecting Krypton (says something about even his ""cruelty"" was to serve Krypton\'s greater good). The glove symbolizes his power philosophy.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'There is a theory that superman flies by manipulating gravity around him    Lex Luthor once theorized that Superman had to stem from a gigantic planet with enormous gravity, where his species had developed natural anti-gravity organs to be able to function; on Earth, this would allow him to control his own gravimetric field in order to fly.  as given  here     So what zod is actually is doing is nothing but manipulating the gravity around him.This means some level of  telekinesis  is possible by kryptonians to some distance.', '', '', '', ""Just rewatched the scene and there's no significance or special trait for that particular piece of his armor as far as I can tell. It seems to me that the reason why it levitated was to help highlight the fact that Zod was beginning to manipulate how gravity affected his personal space (hinting that he would start to 'fly' like Superman, and control the same powers)."", '', '', ""The significance of the scene is to definitely demonstrate that Kryptonians generate a field when flying.  This is suggested a number of times and places throughout the film when Superman takes off, often generating a depression beyond just his feet, and causing particulate to rise and swirl in a pattern suggesting such a field.  The benefit of this is that such a field provides generous apologetics for many of the powers, abilities, and tropes typically ascribed to Superman and his feats.  For example, being able to produce super-strength doesn't work if looking at Superman, whose mass does not increase and whose acceleration is insufficient to generate the force that we see on the object.  However, if Superman is literally able to project a forcefield and put more arbitrary force into his movements... that is, get more- impossible- value out of his otherwise human-range movements... then you can get super strength which aligns with the expectations of the audience."", '', '', ""Just adding my 2 cents.

Neither of these propositions is true but they seem to be frequently held by people whose training and experience is not in communications.   The passive voice can be used to conceal the actor. ""John hit Frank"" becomes ""Frank got hit"" with the accusatory ""by John"" elided out. Thus it absolves the speaker either of taking responsibility or of assigning it. Communicators who seem unsure of themselves or who don\'t really want to communicate at all often take refuge in the passive to avoid taking or assigning responsibility.   If people are in a field where passive documentation is common, they may simply copy that style.

They are fairly useless against an army with reavers or archons though, so be careful against protoss. Combining them with a defiler's dark swarm can make them particularly effective vs terran. Another use of them is the dreaded 'crackling drop'. (Zerglings are often referred to as cracklings after they have the adrenal gland upgrade). A drop of 20+ cracklings into the enemy main or an expo can do massive damage to their base very quickly if their army is not nearby to stop it immediately.

If the raised bed is set on a flat roof, a wooden deck, patio that would be subject to staining by the soil, etc. then you would want a bottom on it. You still need to allow for some drainage.

Not a problem for a flower bed but a concern if you are growing veggies or other edibles.', '', '', ""The main purpose of building raised beds is to be able to grow in a custom soil mix because your current soil is poor. The raised bed soil is usually lighter, fluffier, holds more water and has more nutrients. It's more of a potting soil.  Most flowers don't have very deep roots, especially annuals, and if you have a big difference in soil textures between your existing soil (hard) and raised bed soil (soft) the roots will grow thicker and more dense in the potting mix and become thinner in the existing soil. Look into which plants you plan on growing and see how well they do in soil as deep as your raised beds.  You don't need to put a hard bottom in your raised beds but many people use a weed fabric to keep weed seeds from germinating in the existing soil. Weeds can dig through quite a bit of soil to reach light if the soil in the raised bed is soft and light.  Weed fabric will block weeds while still allowing drainage.  If you're putting raised bed right up against your house (or other structure) you may want to put some water impermeable fabric on the bottom as a slope to direct drainage away from the house. Dig a small bit of the soil under where the raised bed is and slope it away from the house.

So you can swap in levels that you already have high item counts for.

Somewhat. The higher the floor, the more credits you earn when you bring someone to it.

For instance, I like all my residential floors to be the even number floors. The reason is that when I want to speed up imperial objects being built, if an arrival wants an even number of floor, I know I can use them to speed up the imperial object without worry about them being useful to speed up a civilian order.

The game never tells you when stock needs ordering so you have to continually inspect all floors by scrolling from very top to very bottom.  Clumping often-needs-stock floors minimizes scrolling.

Would this component require a heat sink?,"['Would  this  LM7805 voltage regulator require a heat sink?  It will regulate 12V to 5V and will be used for a 5V sensor which draws 4mA current.', '', '', ""No, this would not require a heatsink.   To answer your problem, you first need to know the  power  dissipated by the component. To do this, it is a simple calculation of  P \xa0=\xa0 IV . Thus, your power dissipated would be 4\xa0mA * (12\xa0V\xa0−\xa05\xa0V)\xa0=\xa00.028\xa0W which is equal to 28\xa0mW.   Your next step is to look at the thermal properties of the component.   As you can see, the Max operating temperature is 125\xa0°C.   Now you look at the Junction to Air Thermal Resistance. For the TO-220 package, it is 65\xa0°C/W. Using this, you take your power value that you calculated earlier (0.028\xa0W) and plug it into this equation. Doing that, you get: 65\xa0°C/W\xa0*\xa00.028\xa0W\xa0=\xa01.82\xa0°C which means your 7805 will heat up by approximately 2\xa0°C above the ambient temperature. If we assume you are working in an ambient of 25\xa0°C, this means your component wil heat up to approximately 27\xa0°C, this is well within the specified temperature range, and thus does not need a heatsink.  Following these steps will enable you to calculate similar things in the future.  ADDED  As Colin pointed out in his answer, the 78L05 might be cheaper for you, and is meant to be used in low current applications, as it has a max output current of 100\xa0mA, which is still more than what you need.  Using the calculations from before, we can look at any datasheet for the component. I am using  THIS  one and we can find the thermal characteristics.   The TO-92 package is the 'Z' package which has a Junction to Air Thermal Resistance of 230\xa0°C/W. We can now use this value in the previous equation: 230\xa0°C/W\xa0*\xa00.028\xa0W\xa0=\xa06.44\xa0°C, which again, is more than fine for you to use without worrying.  EDIT:  I did forget to include the current of the 7805 IC itself. This was however, mentioned in the answer by Spehro Pefhany.

"If I lift weights and eat exactly my calorie requirements, what will happen to my body?","[""I know I won't lose or gain weight if I lift and eat my exact calorie requirement (including the calories burnt during a workout) - but what will happen to my bodyfat percentage? Will no muscle grow and no fat be burnt?"", '', '', 'My answer would be that you do not give sufficient information on your diet to tell what will happen to your body either good or bad. Here is why:  I suspect that by controlling your calorie intake and exercising you want to achieve good figure and/or stay fit and healthy which is great.   Sure your body needs a daily source of energy which is provided by each of the main so called macronutrient classes: protein (4 calorie/g), fat (9 calorie/g) and carbohydrate (4 calorie/g). However keep in mind that calorie is simply a unit of energy which applies to food without specifying the actual nutrient class or nutrition value of it. Remember that a healthy diet should balance the relative amount of these macronutrients classes. Balance is needed to meet not only your energy needs for physical and brain activities but also to provide the right amount of constitutive molecular bricks to maintain your body healthy.   Also of high importance are classes of nutrient not directly related to energy. The micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals are required for your body to keep working properly. Remember the story of sailors sailing accross oceans for months suffering from atrocious tooth decay because of lack of vitamin. Vitamins and minerals though sold as chemical supplements occur naturally in meat, dairy products, vegetables and fruit.   An other advantage of consuming fruits and vegetables is they contain fibers. Fibers provide optimal bowel movement which in turn reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.  Other components present in food which have nothing to do with energy should be on the contrary avoided or their intake reasonabily limited. This is the case for salt which excess of consumption has been demonstrated to enhance the risk of heart desease. Moreover a list of undesired chemicals which are added or develop during the making of processed food are also regarded as unhealthy.  As a conclusion do not think of your body as only a calorie burner. Staying healthy and fit is at least in part a matter of nutrition which means you should actively choose the right food to eat. There is a lot of good books written by nutritionists to help you choose based on science.  To me eating healthy can also be guided by common sense. It is reasonable to think that the body we have inherited from our hunter-gatherer ancestors has not been shaped to eat extra sugar- and fat-rich chocolate bars off trees!', '', '', ""You'll probably firm up a bit and lose some fat over time.

Hot-spots and rubbing are usually an indication of a poor fit (toe-box too narrow or wide, boot too long / short, too much volume around the bridge, too much volume around the ankle etc...)

Time to condition is also affected by how good the fit is to start with, at least to the degree that we're talking about conditioning for comfort.

This will help you expand your vocabulary, get more at ease with sentence structures, spelling and grammar and if you read specific things coming from newspapers, magazines and other articles relevant to what you are studying, it can definitely help you both in your English and in your own knowledge and awareness in your field!  You might also want to hang around chatrooms where they are people who share your interests. Those are often more dynamic but less formal English, which also helps. I'm sure you can find ones which can be at the same time interesting (even if you don't participate in the conversation) and help you with your own English. Now, those people shouldn't be the type who 'txt spk', I wouldn't advise to hang around that chatroom if they speak like that. I'm myself chatrooms where people discuss about programming languages and they don't text speak, so I'm pretty sure you can find some decent ones too."", '', '', 'In addition to reading (as suggested by others), practice writing in contexts that are already available to you.

There is more to software documentation than inline comments in the code; go beyond that, even if it\'s not part of the assigned work, and you will both practice writing and develop skills that will help you in a software career.  A lot of programmers can\'t write a coherent design document or technical specification; if you can, you\'re a step ahead.  Practicing writing is good, but how do you know how well you\'re doing?  If your professors aren\'t able/willing to review documentation as part of grading your code homework/projects, see if your university has advisors who can help with that.  Some schools have people whose job includes helping students improve their writing; usually (from what I understand) this means graduate students working on theses, but ask your curriculum advisor, any professor, or someone in the careers center if your school has such services.  If it does, any of those should be able to connect you.  Finally, if your school has classes in technical writing (which will probably be offered by the English department), see if there\'s a low-level course that\'s open to non-majors.

What's special about a 6/8 meter: There is an inherent ambiguity -- shall I think of this, or conduct this, with six beats in the measure, or with two beats in the measure?

As you are playing, it may sometimes feel like two groups of three beats in a measure, and sometimes like two beats per measure.

If you don\'t stretch the bird understanding of #6, it could have just been him realizing they were worried about something, and at sea, that would most likely be a big storm.

He even uses his one good arm to lift Illumi above his head and break his arm through force of grip alone.  I think he could do this for two reasons.  First, his athleticism was being amplified by anger, boosting his strength.  This is a recognized phenomenon in our world, see the  Scientific American  article  When Fear Makes Us Superhuman . Also note that Illumi offered no resistance.  I think this was due to a combination of honest surprise and curiosity, a recognition that Gon was not a mortal threat, and the knowledge that Hisoka had already claimed Gon as his prey.

Are there any good tutorials that illustrate positions where a player turns a thick group into a heavy one?"", '', '', 'You know your stones are thick when they form a safe group that secures some territory and/or build some influence, threatens to attack... or just give you some kind of advantage.  There is no official definition for ""heavy stones"", but I think the term was used instead of the term  bad shape  for a group of 5 stones or more.  In any case, if you have a group of stones all connected together that doesn\'t do much to secure some territory or reduce the opponent\'s, then you probably have a bad, heavy, over concentrated shape.  -----EDIT-----  To add to my answer, I found some good definitions and examples of  heavy vs overconcentrated  and  heavy  which might be useful to you.', '', '', '', '', 'The terms thickness and influence are precisely defined and very easy to differentiate once you got the idea.  Influence simply refers to a group facing the center of the board.  If a group create influence and at the same time is already alive or can make eyes very easily is called thick. Note that a living group that is facing the edge of the board is not thick.  Distinguishing between thickness and heaviness or overconcentration is more difficult.  Heaviness refers to a group of many stones yet few eyespace. Typically, it is created by trying to save too many stones, or by playing bad shape.  Overconcentration is a different phenomenon and refers to cramped positions, typically hand in hand with a violation of the wall+1 rule. Overconcentrated positions tend to be extremely thick, far past the peak of efficiency.', '', '', ""I'm no expert (10k on a good day) but if you follow the general rule of  playing away from thickness  you should be off to a good start.

We only speak of thickness in the context of outward influence, while strong enclosed groups or groups with limited potential for expansion are rather called ""solid"".  Most of the answers get this part right. But ""heavy"" is not at all the same as ""overconcentrated"".  Heavy stones are never thick: they may be large in number, but they lack eye potential, sometimes even making dumpling shapes. They are weak and vulnerable. More importantly, they are not easy to sacrifice, so they place a burden on the player.  Overconcentrated stones on the other hand can be and often are thick: if a player has created 3 or more eyes for his group, such investment was exaggerated, hence the stones are called overconcentrated.  Now if you start to fill all your eyes, turning it into a dumpling shape, a thick, overconcentrated group will become heavy indeed. But this would really be a novice mistake.  Next to that, it is imporant to understand that ""being thick, heavy or overconcentrated"" can be an aspect of a local group, but also of the entire distribution of stones.

Designing your own ESC is a perfect choice and much cheaper even than the cheapest $10 one with HUGE power.

If you get an advance do you ever have to give it back?,"[""Do publishers give you an advance as some sort of earnest money for your manuscript?

You won\'t receive any further royalties for your book until it\'s sold enough copies that the royalties you would have earned cover the advance. If your book fails to ""earn out"" the advance (sell enough copies to cover the advance), you can expect to have a hard time getting another contract with that publisher, and possibly with other publishers as well.', '', '', '', 'Maybe .

In general, though, once the publisher has accepted the book and you have delivered, the advance is yours to keep. If the book doesn't sell well enough, then the publisher takes a loss.

Is there an official answer?', '', '', '', '', 'Batman the Animated Series  (September 5, 1992) was inspired by a variety of previous animated series including the famed Max Fleischer\'s, Superman produced by  Fleischer Studios  in the 1940s and based on the artwork of producer and artist Bruce Timm. Timm was also inspired by the various Batman series, both animated and live action. You can see his homages in his depictions of the Batmobile, the Batcave and the technology used by Batman.   A homage to the live-action Batmobile launching sequence, complete with the flame jet and fins.   Considering its influences, it was designed to have a relatively timeless appearance with the automobiles having a rounded 1940-1950s look but having more modern looking trains. There are dirigibles and helicopters, so it mixes and matches technology from a range of modern eras ranging from the 40s to the 90s.  The look even coined its own name, ""Dark Deco"" which was a mix of retro-modern appearance and intentionally obfuscates what era it is meant to depict. This look was perpetuated in the later Superman the Animated Series and the Justice League Animated Series spin-offs. The look is designed to represent a relatively modern time period without giving too many hints of the era of its origin literally creating a cartoon outside of time.

Overall I like to think it\'s set in the fifties, and the dialogue is intentionally written to reflect the common lingua franca of the era. Though it should be noted that when the series was re-vamped to match up with Superman, it changed drastically to be more modern (Which killed it for me).

I\'m sure too that the original Batman timeline was set in the 1940\'s-50\'s but I may be wrong, and because the series was made in the 90\'s, it can\'t help but somehow have little present day (1990\'s) references.', '', '', 'From what I read, it takes place in the \'90s and has modern technology.

Asking is always the best policy, BUT if you're actually good at playing and play something situation appropriate in my experience most places will turn a blind eye -- they're getting free 'mood music' essentially.

How can I ensure a chubby spawn?,"[""I've played a few hours between two characters having never seen a chubby monster spawn anywhere (as far as I recall anyway) and then I ran into two during my first trip to the caustic caverns with my second character.

There\'s a Chubby Rakk. I\'ve seen this one myself. I have also been in this area about 100 times looking for Donkey Mong and never saw a second one (or Donkey Mong) so the rate seems to be very very low.  Right inside the Caustic Caverns there\'s a Chubby Varkid spawn location. I\'ve gone through this area maybe 2-3 dozen times? And never seen it.   I wouldn\'t bother  actively  seeking these guys. As with most ""rare"" things in Borderlands 2, they\'re  far  too rare to make actively hunting them any fun. For the record I\'m at over 150 hours game time and I\'ve seen  one . Allegedly the caustic caverns one is easy to make appear but I\'ve never tried seeking it out.  Interestingly there\'s a  lot  of Chubby Rakk that spawn in an area in the Tourge DLC in a specific area (the only Rakk in the whole DLC, a mission takes you to the area).

Hint though: more players means a higher spawn rate of these enemies.   I play system link with two brothers and dad. We have gotten a ton of ultimate varkids in caustic caverns. All you do is get the varkids to attack the crystalisk since they can't kill each other. Then you just sit in the cave at the beginning, keeping the varkids in combat mode so pods timer does not reset. What I mean by the timer is that a regular small varkid does not take long to go into pod form, adult takes a bit longer, bad*** takes longer, and so forth.   As long as they are noted on your mini map as red dots during the mutation process, you should be able to keep them mutating! Best to have three wait at the beginning of Caustic Cavern's and one player lead the varkids to the crystalisk and wait in the cave. Then you sit and let the varkids mutate. The higher the level of varkid such as super or ultimate, the lower they will go into pod form and the longer the time it takes for them to.

In a linear regulator the circuit parameter is the pass transistor drive circuit (which produces base current for an NPN/PNP power transistor, gate voltage for a MOSFET).  In a switching regulator the circuit parameter is the duty cycle of the switching element(s).  So there\'s really two areas you need to understand if you want to get into the details of  how regulators work:   topology design (achieve required limits of current/voltage/etc)  control loop tuning + stability', '', '', 'Voltage regulators have a transistor which in a control loop can conduct more or less, according to demand, so that\'s a bit like a variable resistor. This schematic shows the basic principle upon which most linear regulators are built:     The zener diode is a 6.2V version, so the node marked ""feedback"" needs about 6.8V to make Q1 conduct. R1+R2 divide the output voltage by 2, so that makes the output 13.6V. If the output voltage would rise, Q1 would start conducting and pull the base of Q2 down, so that Q2 supplies less current to the output and its voltage decreases again. If the output voltage will go below the set voltage of 13.6V, Q1 switches off and via R3 the input voltage will give Q2 sufficient current so that the output voltage rises again. So Q1 will make sure that the output remains at 13.6V.    This is a very basic setup, and stability and line regulation are not optimal. Integrated voltage regulators will add extra components for increased (temperature) stability, current limiting and overheating protection.', '', '', 'This is an excellent way to understand the theory. A linear regulator will use a transistor to step the voltage down as an inline resistor(the transistor can be modeled as a variable resistance) with feedback changing its resistance to get a very dependable output voltage.

feeling when you've failed in your job,"[""Is there a phrase for when a teacher uses an example that they think should be obvious. but the students get it wrong. So the teacher is disappointed in that they've wasted all that time and need to reteach the basic principles again."", '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Having been a teacher, I know the feeling of giving my students what I consider to be the perfect example to illustrate a concept I\'m teaching, only to be met with stony faces or uncomprehending looks.  Competent teachers learn not to take that reaction personally; rather, they attempt to come up with another example that rings their students\' bells or causes their light of understanding to turn on.  I am not saying that a teacher\' failure to make a concept crystal clear is always, or even necessarily, the teacher\'s fault. Sometimes a significant portion of a class can be resistant to learning, inattentive, hindered by learning disabilities, and so on. Resourceful teachers, however, when facing uncomprehending looks, simply attack the concept from a different vantage point by using different examples and sometimes even wildly diverse and far-out methods.  The teacher who takes a temporary setback personally and with a deep sigh goes back to the line-upon-line, precept-upon-precept method of re-teaching foundational facts is likely experiencing a form of  cognitive dissonance , a concept elucidated by  Dr. Leon Festinger  years ago and elaborated by countless theoreticians and social psychologists ever since the theory burst on the scene.  In essence, cognitive dissonance arises in a person when he fails to experience an expected outcome. Consequently, his dis-ease triggers disappointment, ambivalence, embarrassment, frustration, discomfort and even anger.  Put differently, cognitive dissonance rears its head when a person entertains two conflicting ideas or concepts in his or her mind at the same time, and then through a process of choosing one idea in preference to the other idea attempts to get rid of the dissonance. Some people are more immune to cognitive dissonance than others, but it is most likely a universal human experience.  A teacher who sees herself as a really good teacher may, upon experiencing the phenomenon you describe in your question, begin to question her teaching ability, asking such questions as    Am I really as good as I think I am?   Am I in the right profession?   What am I doing wrong, such that the whole class doesn\'t seem to ""get it""?     Another tack might be to cast blame on the students and resolve the dis-ease she feels by saying such things as    This class is simply not very bright.   This class is not willing to learn.   These students are apathetic.     The truly competent teacher, on the other hand, engages neither in self-doubt nor the blame-game; rather, he regroups with his self-concept intact and attacks the problem as he believes a good teacher would by inventing new examples, trying different teaching methods, and forging ahead despite a temporary setback.  The former teacher is tempted to ""cut her losses"" and give up. The latter teacher takes his students\' failure to understand as a challenge for him to step up his game.  Disappointment itself is a universal human experience and emotion. Some people deal with it better than others. Some folks do not even feel disappointment until they reach a certain fairly high threshold, as in the case of a teacher who has used  numerous  examples (not just one) to elucidate a concept for her students, only to be confronted with the furrowed brows of incomprehension.  In summary, I think cognitive dissonance describes aptly the phenomenon you describe in your question. How a teacher experiences and deals with the frustration and disappointment triggered by an apparent failure to teach (or a failure of students to learn) depends a great deal on her tenacity, flexibility,  resourcefulness, and good humor, all of which keep a temporary setback in the learning process in perspective by not allowing it to define either her or her students.', '', '', 'Crestfallen.

Any assistance would be very much appreciated, and feel free to share any of your own recipes for crispy chicken breading if you have them. I'll be sure to put them to good use!  Thanks!"", '', '', ""First, use self-rising flour or use 1 teaspoon of baking powder added to each cup of all-purpose flour that you're using for the dredging and coating mixture.  The carbon dioxide produced during frying will cause the coating to expand and become more flaky.  If you want more tender and flavorful chicken, first brine the pieces in buttermilk that has been mixed with several tablespoons of salt, some black pepper and whatever other seasonings you like.  Otherwise just dip the chiken in buttermilk seasoned with salt and pepper.   Before dredging the chicken, sprinkle a little milk or water over your seasoned flour mixture.   Shake the flour mixture around so that it asborbs the liquid, this will help create small crunch bits that will later adhere when you dredge the chicken.  Dredge the chicken and then return to the milk and then dredge again to get a thicker coating of flour.  Deep fry in enough oil to submerge, or pan-fry in enough oil to come about 2/3 up the chicken and turn a couple times to promote even browning.  Alternatively, after pan frying until evenly brown all around, remove from oil and place on a baking rack on a sheet pan and finish cooking in the oven until the chicken is done."", '', '', '', 'The way to get crispy chicken is double breading the chicken and immersion frying.  Basically, you need a tub with your flour and seasonings in it, a basin for water and someplace to place the breaded product.

Once you have the station set up, you are ready to start breading.  Take your chicken pieces and dip in the water, then place them in the flour.  Remove from the flour and shake the excess off the chicken (preferably back into the flour basin). Then re-dip into the water, straight up and down to ensure very little breading loss.

If all your sentences are short, occasionally weaving together the ideas in several of them by recursion will get you the length variety you need.

They both include clear explanations and some very good examples.  It strikes me that if you already know these things and you are still struggling with writing long sentences, then perhaps you need to look deeper into the reasons why you tend to write short sentences. Is it perhaps that your sentences are reflecting your thought processes? Alternatively, is it possible that you have been taught that short sentences in writing are a good thing and that, on some level, you are reluctant to break free from that early conditioning?  I notice that you use several short sentences in your question (this being the only sample of your writing that I have) and that it would have been possible for you to have joined them into longer sentences. Maybe you can spend a few minutes asking yourself why you chose to chop your question into short segments. I feel that you would benefit from exploring this aspect.

Secondly as far as I can tell Canada forced the issue. A couple of years after introducing the loonie they stopped issuing dollar bills. So those requiring a $1 denomination for making change had no choice but to accept the coins.

The US had another go at trying to push dollar coins in the late 2000s with various native american and presidential designs in the hope of stirring up interest and getting people to use the coins but again they didn\'t force the issue, again reception was lackluster and again they ended up with a big stockpile of coins.

What is the correct temperature when extracting saffron flavour?,"['I have several recipes that call for saffron.

Religious Context   Consuming Halaal is at your discretion and one thing, but to ban Halaal (by force) is altogether a different thing - some practices are OK as long as not codified as laws - especially with all the history and constitutional rights of religious freedom.   All these factors work in tandem, reinforcing each other; there is no single bone of contention. The  religious  question before Indian Muslims is not whether they can avoid cows but rather how to deal politically, as a minority community, in a secular country when your tradition is challenged, when it had been in practice for centuries. Admittedly, there exists no canonical  Fiqh of politics for a Muslim minority  that would serve as a guideline for the community of Muslims in India, which is precisely why there are varied reactions to it. Had there been such a Fiqh it would have answered questions like ""Should such a law be accepted?"" ""Should it be challenged in a court of law?"" ""Should there be civil disobedience and under what circumstances?"" and so on.

What does the Bible say about God being a different type of being than man?,"['Most Christians believe God and man are different types of being (Mormons are a notable exception).

Of course, being higher doesn\'t necessarily imply being  different . But we have further proof in that God is  omnipotent and omniscient .

The final point is that God was  the first one  (as He was before the world and there is only one God). But, one could argue, does the order of existence imply being a different  type  of being?  I think it\'s quite  obvious  that God is a different type of being than man.   But that\'s arguable—it depends on how the types of beings are defined, i.e. the chosen taxonomy. Similarly, men and natural satellites are quite different, but you could come up with a  classification that puts them into the same class.', '', '', 'Along with what dancek posted, I would suggest that  Numbers 23:19  speaks pretty clearly that God is not man, but something greater:    19 God is not man, that he should lie,         or a son of man, that he should change his mind.

Now there\'s a couple dubious aspects to this--but my question is simply: can chain slap result in structural damage?', '', '', ""YES and NO  Depending on the type of frame and type of riding you are doing it could be a problem.   YES (you might have a problem)   If you have a  steel  frame slapping of the chain can damage the paint which is very important in keeping oxidants like water and air away from the bare steel. Steel will rust and eventually fail catastrophically.  If you have a  composite mountain bike frame , chain slap can damage the outer layers of fiber which generally carry the most load. Nicks made by the chain in the frame's resin could be propagation sites for cracks that can lead to delaminating and failure. If you are missing or have worn through the factory included sticker guards, I would apply some type of wear guard.   NO (It won't be a problem)   If you have  aluminum ,  stainless steel  or another  relatively  non-corrosive metallic frame, no amount of beating with a chain is going to cause the thing to break. Aluminum and stainless steel are ductile materials and are very hard to damage without hitting them very hard with a large mass or by using some type of lever to bend them.   Probably No...   If you have a  composite road bike , chain slap  can  damage the outer layers of fiber or  could  cause cracks in the frame as well, however the likelyhood of this happening is very small. Composite frame manufacturers generally include one ply of weave fiber on the lower chain stays to increase the durability along with a plastic sticker which should be more than adequate for many years of riding.    For what it’s worth I have <14 lbm composite road bike and I would never think of adding electrical tape (I’m counting grams here) for something as silly as chain slap."", '', '', 'The only situation in which I could see that being the case would be with a carbon MTB frame, a rider who is using it far beyond it\'s intent, and a poorly set up drivetrain.

Given the example of a dream within a dream, I assume that you're thinking of a distinct object that is inside another object, not an object which is a part of another object.  An object that is inside another object can be said to be  embedded . The inner object can be of the same type as the outer object or of a different type. Some examples of usage include:   A pole is  embedded  in the ground: it's inserted in the ground and can't be removed easily.  An  embedded journalist  is one who belongs to the team that he's reporting on, for example an army reporter who is part of an army unit.  A computer document that is  embedded  in another computer document is stored in the same file and displayed as part of the larger document, for example a picture in a word processor document.  In linguistics,  embedding  refers to the ability to build up clauses that are part of a sentence.  Recursion  is embedding of a clause inside a clause of the same form."", '', '', 'Subset :   Subset is defined as a portion, particularly in mathematics.
