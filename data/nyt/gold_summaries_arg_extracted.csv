I have been trying to access spelling bee for three weeks now with no success.', 'Terrific puzzle!  (No surprise there.  it\'s EC & HR.) My only for-sure gimmes were ABBOTT and ANTIGONE, but I had a lot of maybes, and when I tried them out they were almost all right. I had a co-worker once who was a big TINTIN fan and had the comics pinned up all over his cubicle, so that was a leg up for me.  My first thought re ""Din"" was indeed KIPLING, but I held off, thinking they wouldn\'t dare.  Hah!  KLINGONS were an early thought too, but I was sure there were other HIGH-BROWed aliens. With a few letters, I took a chance on LOT\'S WIFE as sounding appropriately Biblical, especially with Mount Sodom. Dredged up memories of COUSTEAU and HERZOG from the clues!  Forget ESPOSITO; needed all but one letter, and then took a chance. One mistake:  The only Gourmets I remembered were the Galloping and the Frugal.  So I guessed and put in HAPPY, which of course had me grasping my STING RAY by its SPARACLES.  Well, at least I knew where to look for my error when the music didn\'t come. Hardest clue/word:  SKI SUIT.  Now to go look up ""salopette"" and see if I\'ve ever seen one. Thanks for the fun to my two favorite SLYBOOTS.', ""ABBOTT and NARNIA were about it for me where gimmes were concerned.  I had LASERS in and took it out several times.  I have heard of Drake, so I tried RAPPING, and after a little thought came up with KLINGONS.  I saw spiracles but wasn't sure it was real."", ""Started out nicely with COUSTEAU, ABBOTT, NARNIA, HERZOG, and KLINGONS. Thought of LASERS, but for some reason was hesitant to put it in. But I had enough to dig right in to the quote. I guessed a bit on You can... up a good-... and your, and soon had ...is the best way to lift... I looked up LOTS WIFE and ESPOSITO. Then I took a side trip to remember the Galloping Gourmet, which I used to watch a lot. Didn't know of the HIPPY, YCLEPT or SLYBOOTS. Finally thought of TINTIN when I got the Ts, but Gunga Din really tricked me. Good one! I was thinking of unruly children. Loved the part about the bowling ball. It's tempting to try it out, but they would probably get mad at me over at the Academy of Sciences.  P.S. Probably best not to refer to Tintin as French lit to a Belgian."", ""As always, we enjoy a good Acrostic! Alas, though, it fell too quickly due to repeated words in the quotation. (But without them we'd never have gotten some of those words -- for example, RAPPERS, KLINGONS, and SKISUIT. So we shouldn't complain.)"", 'I had a bunch of gimmes for this one--LOT’S WIFE, YCLEPT, ABBOTT, NARNIA, DAY LILY, RAPPING, ANTIGONE. Also a couple of guesses that turned out to be wrong and led me into fruitless paths--ROBOTS for LASERS and STIFFENS for RIGIDIFIES. For the third word, I had PI-- and tried various letters for the 4th space. K gave me KIPLING immediately, with a groan (my first thought for ""Din creator"" was TODDLER). SKI SUIT and COUSTEAU appeared once I had a few letters of those words. Democritus was the only early Greek atom guy I could think of and I couldn\'t even really think of his name (I thought it started with a D) but since he was the wrong guy it ended up not mattering at all. Once I had filled in ""spiracles"" I did look it up to make sure it was actually a word. ""Good-sized"" was the absolute last thing I filled in--had no idea what that hyphenated word was going to be.

I suppose next you'll say that Poirot wasn't French either."", 'Or telling us he was a leek.', ""I only had one gimme, ANTIGONE, but was pretty sure of LASER.  Not exactly enough to start working from the quote, so did some googling.  Even when I had quite a few answers I had more trouble than usual getting word in the quote as nothing was making much sense to me.  The breakthrough came when I finally got STING RAY (I always thought that was one word). Then that fun toggle back and forth bit came quite quickly. Favourite misdirection was Din creator which fooled me completely.   Good fun as always My print has suddenly changed to italics, don't know why, don't know if it will look like that in the comments and don't know how to change it back.  No italics here anyway."", 'ABBOTT was my only gimme, which was my excuse for using Google far earlier than I usually allow. Very difficult but not unfair.

The c-section was the easiest recovery of the three. I was so freaked out about the c-section that I might have tried a vaginal delivery with that baby, too, if I had been able to find a doctor who would let me attempt a vaginal breech delivery. There weren't any. As my husband said, there is probably a reason for that. Like antibiotics, c-sections save lives. We should use them when they're needed and not when they're not."", ""My 92 year old mother had 9 C-sections... she is healthy for her age as are all 9 of us.  Perhaps something has changed in the process in the last 50+ years since her last one... or maybe there are just too many variables in our lives and C-section procedures for science to isolate one as the cause of any particular problem.  The percentages mentioned are increases in probabilities, but no mention of whether that's a 17% increase in a .000001% chance?  Poorly written at best."", 'It\'s infuriating when people assume that c-section moms feel like they have failed. I promise I have no regrets about being alive and having two healthy babies. I did not ""miss out"" on the birth experiences. I had two birth experiences.', 'My first son was delivered by an unnecessary C-section. I was able to breast-feed. He developed just fine, did not not get asthma, and is nowhere near obese. I healed up ok from the operation, but I was disappointed not to have given birth vaginally. My second child was born vaginally. The doctor gave me an episiotomy, but I also tore. Of course I required quite a lot of stitches and it made for an uncomfortable recovery, to say the least. My baby, completely breast-fed, developed an eczema that wouldn\'t quit, which finally sort of cleared, only to be replaced by asthma. And don\'t even get me started on the food allergies. And now, twenty years later, I have a rectocele, a cystocele, and a gradually falling uterus. I get up about 2-3 times in the night to go to the loo. Which is not to say those anatomical things wouldn\'t have happened anyway, but the vaginal birth experience surely hastened them along. This little ""article"" on the ""risks""  of c-sections is nothing but click bait.', 'Did they factor into the risk for the outcome the reasons for the c-section in the first place?  There are built in medical reasons for a lot of c sections that affect the health of the mother and child after birth.', 'I read this article twice and could not find any ""long term risks to the mother"" mentioned at all, unless she pursues future pregnancies. Instead, it starts off by citing several long-term BENEFITS of C-sections. Maybe that would have been a better title: ""Cesarean Delivery Can Have Long Term Benefits to Mother, But Theoretical Risks for Child.""  You could also publish an article: ""Vaginal Delivery Can Pose Long-Term Risks to Mother And Child"" and it would be equally true. But they wouldn\'t publish that because C-sections are supposed to be evil and we\'re supposed to hate them, and vaginal births are supposed to make all our kids skinny, perfectly healthy geniuses. Personally, I loved my scheduled C-section. I didn\'t take longer to heal, certainly not nearly as long as my friends who tore pushing for many hours. I sleep 8 straight hours without ever having to get up to go to the bathroom and have never had a second\'s incontinence, ever. My child is skinny and perfectly healthy with no allergies and a wonderful appetite. So are both my parents in their 70s/80s, who were fed exclusively with whatever formula was available in 1940. I\'m tired of these articles that push public health propaganda and stigmatize women who — often very reasonably, often because it is the only option — have C-sections and use baby formula.', ""This article is a very short synopsis to a complicated medical issue. Pregnancy is a very complex human condition. During pregnancy there are multiple changes in a woman's body that increase the chance of blood clots, hemorrhage, hypertension, diabetes, gall bladder disease, kidney problems and more. In general it is better to avoid surgery whenever possible because of the risks of anesthesia, bleeding and infection. However, every situation is specific to the patient and her condition. The goal with every pregnancy should be healthy mom and baby."", ""I wanted a healthy baby and my giant baby was not coming out except by c-section.  We both did well. I did not have a subsequent pregnancy, but if I had, I would have had prenatal care to ensure the best possible outcome. Stop scaring people!  Most women want a BABY, and they will accept it however it arrives.  My doctor stayed up all night with me, hoping that my son would emerge vaginally, but when he did not, he was ready to perform the c-section that saved my son's life. I was grateful then, grateful now and would do it again if I had to."", 'I requested a c-section because I was young and terrified.  Thankfully, my doctor reassured me and I had a wonderful birth experience.  Several friends have had c-sections for various medically necessary reasons.  Though they did have longer slower recoveries their children are healthy.  Well, there are risks either way we are so fortunate to have so many relatively safe birthing options.', 'C-sections are often life saving. However, we certainly do too many of them these days. They are harder to recover from and carry the risk of more complications. Part of the issue is unnecessary inductions of first time moms that often fail and end in c-section. These moms will then usually have a repeat c-section with the next baby. C-sections can delay breast milk production and lead to more failure of breast feeding especially in first time moms. These are issues that we can work to improve in obstetrics.', ""My 32 year old daughter just requested her birth certificate to get the exact time she was born because she wanted her astrology chart read. I knew the time was somewhere between 6pm and 9pm-ish but wasn't certain. That's because at about 5:30pm, after 24 hours in a labor that never progressed, her heart monitor strip showed heart deceleration - signs that she was in distress. As a medical student in labor, I went 'deer in the headlights' and time froze as they prepped us for c-section. She just told me that her birth certificate said she was born at 6:02pm. We must have been rushed to c-section. She was born a tired but healthy baby, and in my opinion, has grown to be a brilliant young woman.  Apparently, my pelvis has bony projections that prevent a normal sized fetus from exiting. My second child was a scheduled section, during which the anesthesia almost killed me. Still, I am grateful for two normal and lovely adult children and 32 years as their mother. I know that would have not been how things played out if my daugher and I had lacked access to a c-section.  Yes I would have preferred a successful vaginal delivery. Yes, she had a lot of ear infections as a young child (perhaps maternal vaginal microbiome deficit??). Yes, my lower abdominal muscles are weak and weird from the two surgeries - but I don't think either of us would have made it well through the first delivery."", 'I had 2 vaginal deliveries AND was a full-time, stay-at-home, breastfeeding mom. My kids were constantly sick; the younger one had to have tubes in her ears at 13 months after both eardrums burst. I think the microbiome thing is overhyped.', 'I had 3 c sections, I have no problems and I have three healthy thin adult children, no asthma. I really think it depends on the individual.', ""You need to separate out scheduled c-sections, including for maternal request, from those that are done when a vaginal birth goes wrong--when much of the long-term damage has already occurred. Then you need to compare the statistics for scheduled c-sections against those of all vaginal deliveries. Scheduled c-section have their risks, but one of them is not the tremendous pressure on a woman's delicate nerves and muscles that may never heal well, if at all. Or the tremendous pain often produced by vaginal delivery. To be honest, we need to focus on the health of the woman, physical and psychological, a lot more than the health of her baby--she grows it from nothing but her blood and her bones, then gives it life at risk of her own.  Obstetrics needs to treat women like the creators and life-givers that they are."", ""Rates of maternal death in the US are like third world countries because we do not provide prenatal health services to women (mostly poor women). It's disgusting and disturbing since men make the rules. I guess they forgot they had a mother."", 'So many of us have been encouraged to have c-sections because it is quicker and easier for the doctors. It is a shame that the ob/gyns do not take these serious effects into account.', 'I requested a c-section because I was terrified of a vaginal delivery.  Thankfully my doctor calmed my fears and stressed that the safest option for both myself and my baby.  I was still terrified when the time came but actually had a wonderful birthing experience.', 'Oh please! And what are the long-term risks of vaginal delivery? Let me think...hm...incontinence for Mom and disability for the child. I had two c-sections and no regrets.', 'With respect to the link to obesity, asthma, still birth and miscarriage, did they control for maternal characteristics like socioeconomic status, obesity, diabetes, maternal asthma, etc?  If so, this is interesting.  If not, then it’s silly to publish this and suggest a causal relationship.  The placenta accreta link I bet is causal, but the rest I doubt unless they controlled for these factors.', ""Sigh. Is it really any surprise that woman who had to have a C-section the first time went on to have subsequent pregnancy problems? It seems like there is a confusion between cause and effect to me. The first C-section was a symptom (effect) and the subsequent problems are a symptom (effect). Also, you are always (100% of the time) older with a second or third pregnancy; if you initially had problems, they're not going to get better with time."", ""I nearly died after my second cesarean.  My OB told me the previous scar hadn't let my uterus stretch properly and it was as much thinner than normal for full-term as saran wrap is thinner than a styrofoam cup.  Took them more than two hours to sew me back up because I wouldn't stop bleeding and tearing.  Strange thing is that I had a VBAC between the two."", 'This is devastating for the one-third of US women who undergo a cesarean. They will blame themselves. However, it is lack of access to and support for vaginal birth after cesareans that keeps our cesarean rate going up and up not the failure of women. We need health policy that addresses this as the crisis it is.', ""Disagree that this is devastating for those of us who have had C-sections. It  may  be for some but please do not lump us all into one category.  It is not a personal failure on our parts nor something to blame a competent physician for.  Each case is individual and unique.   I would also like to read the specifics of this study and see it replicated before I get too worked up about it's findings."", 'I think that one of the problems is that not every case is individual and unique, that a certain percentage of women choose c-sections just because it sounds more doable, when they could probably deliver naturally with no complications.']",Almost every single commenter has a negative view of this article.

Batista came on to protect/relieve Zico in the 83rd, with Argentina trailing 3-0. Then Maradona kneed him. An ill tempered match, Ossie Ardiles ended the match with his shirt torn down to his navel.

,New York counties that banned trans fats in foods showed steeper declines in heart disease than those that didn’t have trans fat restrictions.,"['Something along this line should happen with high fructose corn syrup. Of course, you have to fight with the agriculture industry.', 'There is significant momentum across the Region to take action on trans fats. Denmark, Austria, Hungary, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland have set similar limits that virtually ban trans fats from food products, but consumption remains high where no policies are in place. For example, a recent study revealed that people could consume as much as 30 g trans fat per day in some eastern countries in the Region.  This is a concern, as consumption of only 5 g per day is associated with a 23% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease.  Even in European Union countries, high levels of trans fats can still be found in some food categories, and there is some evidence of higher consumption in low socioeconomic groups.*  Denmark has seen several benefits from virtually banning trans fats. •Intake decreased among all age groups, and is now one tenth of the level when the ban was adopted. •Within one year, most products on the Danish market were able to comply with the new limit of 2 g trans fat per 100 g fat. •The overall nutritional profile of food products could improve, including increases in use of healthier fats (such as monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats), according to the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. •The drop in trans-fat consumption may partly account for the significant decrease in mortality from cardiovascular diseases recently experienced in Denmark.', ""Amazing how common sense and taking care of one's self can be so successful in leading to better health and happiness. And it can be done without taking useless pills and crash diets."", 'Trans fats were banned in my family since my parents were in their early 30s. Becoming an M.D. Ph.D. I saw the difference that makes an everyday diet without trans fats. The chairman of nephrology, Pr Lagrue, did an extensive study, in France that was not accepted in the 70s by the international peer reviewed journals. He showed that trans fats, starting after the great depression were as bad as Tobacco for human health. I campaigned since against trans fats, added sugar, GMO, and tobacco. These simple measures can prevent more than 60% of chronic diseases and light up health care bills.', 'Trans fats are likely deadlier than cigarettes, alcohol and illicit drugs.  They should be reclassified as a poison and taken out of our food supply.', 'Would be helpful if your article explained what is a trans fat for those of us who are ignorant about this subject.', 'When trans fat is banned, what substitutes do food manufacturers, restaurants and bakeries use in its place?  This is a good opportunity to identify suitable replacement fats have the taste, presentation and chemical properties acceptable to the food industry.', ""People at home can use lard.  It sounds icky, but you can buy it in squares like margarine, and it can be used to make baked goods.  I don't know about food manufacturers, though."", 'It is true that most people do not know what a trans fat is, how it is manufactured, how it behaves in the body, and why it is dangerous to our health. Most people think a trans fat is just vegetable oil. It is not. It is a mutation of the atoms in vegetable oil by the process of putting oil under high heat and pressure in the presence of nickel. This results in an oil that has a very long shelf life, but that the mitochondria in our bodies cannot metabolize well, resulting in storing the fat (which is chemically like wax) in our arteries. If you do not read labels for trans fats, or hydrogenated vegetable oil, or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, you will not know if you are eating it or not. Our government and the industries that put this in our food, resulting in heart attacks and death since WW11 should be sued. But they will not.

Hopefully the study is on tract to support the positive effects of  government regulation to help improve health. Yes there will be backlash against the ""nanny state"" but ""nanny"" seat belt regulations have prevented many injuries and deaths.', 'One does not need to do such a time and money costing analysis.  One only has to do a comparison of the counties before the ban.  If the counties had a similar heart attack figures before, and different after the ban such a cost of time and money is not worth while.  Also, any eating out of borders would decrease the effect of the ban, not increase it.  And even if the counties with the ban were more educated, they were more educated before the ban too, and the ban reduced heart attacks. This information is both important and priceless. - a retired epidemiologist.', 'This is a good example of how government agencies can make changes to improve public health. Unfortunately, government agencies are often more influenced by industry lobbyists than by serving as the guardians of public health. To make matters worse, industry officials are often recruited to lead government agencies. We are caught in a political predicament that resists rational attempts to prioritize the public interest.', 'It is our good fortune we read, we can teach our children to read labels at a much earlier age.  To teach the great human ritual of making choices and how those choices affect how we feel and function.   The government has nothing to do with how we make nutritional decisions.  Poor DC.

Once again, Spayd just washes her hands of any and all criticism from readers. As is typical of this PE, after printing a Friday column and this column, she and her assistant just head for home.  Not a single reader comment posted for three days.  No other Times column or article with a comments section shows such disregard for readers.  Incredible that the readers representative can\'t be bothered to even post comments for days on end. Last, the Friday column states that Spayd\'s assistant picks out a few comments from readers to bring to Spayd\'s attention, which she then addresses.

Same with Phil Corbett doing away with his own best idea, the After Deadline grammar and usage blog.

But, it is important to note that this does not signal any change in our editorial values or in our understanding of what readers have long told us they cherish about The New York Times."" These sentences seem to be oxymoronic!  Why develop the ""efforts"" at all? I stand by my opinion that the most important ""editorial values"" are curating the news - in the sense of choosing and presenting stories that are  most significant in the editors\' (not the readers\'} view of the world.   Readers will find stories they are ""passionate about"" without assistance. Embedded links, RSS feeds, and email work well for individualizing content without destroying the integrity of the paper as a whole. (Improvements to the search function would help a lot.) The only change I would very much like to see is a filter that allows me to remove all robotic content, e.g., ""Recommended for You,"" ""What You Need to Know About...."" and such. Algorithms will never keep up with my peripatetic reading habits.', 'We may not comment much to this easing back to ""testing"" talk, but we are certainly watching.  If tailoring the great New York Times to be a news source for people 18 to 25 is the plan, you will have a disaster on your hands.  Those young people become more mature daily, time passes, and like the rest of us, they will want and need the depth of knowledge that real journalism can bring, not the picture-story just-for-me stuff that was enough on Facebook.  And choosing that narrow a demographic while clearly pushing away the rest of us is not likely to benefit you, either. Picture the NYT with just the millennial cohort subscribing and you\'ll see what I mean.  Beyond that,  the nation needs a source of information that is for us all, insofar as it can be, that we share and see together and can trust enough to find common ground for some consensus again.  The Vietnam War really ended when Cronkite told the truth about it and people listened who didn\'t want to hear, didn\'t want to believe--but believed anyway.  I know that now the NYT is a lightning rod for those who would divide us, who would make a little America just for themselves.  But don\'t help them do it.  If you have a mission, it is not to please millennials, or me.  But to be a trusted source of news--that we need more than want sometimes--that\'s your mission, in my view.  If it isn\'t, you\'re already gone.', ""SmileyBurnette, I have a  dilemma about hitting the Recommend button under your post. It's pretty good as an explanation, but I hate to think it's meant as a justification."", 'Trouble is, when millennials get old enough to mellow and appreciate depth and complexity, some younger, shallower generation will be the darlings of advertisers.', 'Advertisers do indeed determine their ads by subscribers--numbers of them, their demographics, etc.  Despite the hype of youth, I don\'t know of a ""millennial"" magazine that sells like the New Yorker or Esquire; the ads in those are hardly for the college crowd.  What\'s lasting is what sells to real people, all people who have money to buy.   Selling to the young was one thing when young people had money or older people had the desire to seem young, but mostly they don\'t now.  The message is taking time to get through to some of those who\'ve been selling the ""great new thing!"" up to now. But now the push-selling of youth and of tech for their own sakes will only go so far.  We\'re past that now in many ways. It\'s an old truth that listening to the customers is paramount for sales, and that\'s so for newspapers and for advertising, too.  Ultimately, the real customers will determine the outcome of it all, and the arrogance of those who try to force them and demand of them and scorn them will come to nothing good in the end.', ""I don't have much hope for this effort.  Amazon has a complete record of my book purchases & sends me notes about books I've already read &/or topics outside my interests just because I've ordered books as presents.  If they can't tailor very well in a narrow band of interest, I don't see how The Times can hope to treat a broad range."", 'The Times already ""pushes"" far too much of its content while burying important bits of information, like corrections and acknowledgement of rewrites, where few will ever see them.', 'Ms Spayd, instead of simply putting out a ""Why\'d you do that?"" column, why not actually, you know, advocate for readers?  Why simply regurgitate the remarks of the Times VP in charge of this awful plan?  You have certainly received now hundreds of complaints from readers.  Do you disagree with their criticisms?   Or is it that you simply refuse to take issue with anything that Times management does?', 'Ms. Spayd may know more than we do about how far her bosses will tolerate a troublemaker.', 'Wow, Liz, Kinsey Wilson threw you under the bus, then backed up over you for good measure, stating that your characterization of ""personalization"" was not what they were proposing.', 'Sounds good to me.']","Most commentators level criticism at the staff for reasons such as catering to a younger demographic, trying to get people viewing more targeted ads, and loss of journalistic integrity.

Most of the time, my observations of taxpayer and preparer assertions demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the IRC which is to be expected. Most of the complexity these days is predicated and dependent on the use of computers to calculate passive losses, alternative minimum tax, net investment income, etc. Without computers, the code would not exist as it is. A value added tax would end the industry as we know it, force accountants and tax preparers to get real jobs and end the reflections of tax preparation as a call to understand one's inner self."", 'Paying attention is essential for a successful life. Paying close attention to financial issues like taxes without getting emotionally involved is a tried and true method for success. Meditation and mindfulness are all about paying attention without emotional involvement. So it is logical that these practices would be beneficial to anyone involved in finance, investment or even household budgeting as well as when making major purchases. As a psychotherapist, I have worked with many business clients over the years and have taught all of them mindfulness meditation. I have found that the practice of mindfulness meditation makes them more open and able to innovate far better than before they began their mindfulness practices. Every client who meditates also becomes a far better negotiator as well as a convincing spokesperson. Mindfulness and meditation also enhance critical thinking skills and problem solving. Often it is helpful to have some guidance or a teacher when beginning to do meditation. When a teacher is not available or possible I highly recommend the guided meditation training downloads by Jon Shore at  http://www.meditation-download.com  to most of my clients since they are very effective. One can argue all day about the effectiveness of meditation or mindfulness or one can try it and see for oneself. I usually recommend the second option.', 'give me a break !!

In order to contrast (we thought) the healthy heart rhythms of the students with the lethal ones we had been teaching, we placed monitoring electrodes on the chests of the students. Surprise!

The ""French Paradox"" is the observation that red wine consumption confers protection from cardiovascular disease in Frenchmen with high cholesterol and smoking history.  Other more recent alcohol research may not be so kind to the alcohol industry.   Dr Purohit in his article in 2008 Alcohol says alcohol consumption increases intestinal permeability to gram negative bacteria resulting in translocation of endotoxin (LPS) with low level endotoxemia, a risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease. Indeed studies show a direct correlation between calcium score and alcohol consumption as reported by Dr Mark J. Pletcher in Am J Epidemiology 2005.  I have found this true in clinical practice with heavy drinkers showing very high calcium scores.

Several years ago I bought a harpsichord and studied it with the most amazing teacher I have ever experienced.    I had to discontinue lessons due to family emergencies.  When we were discussing a piece on day she said to me, You know what, you could compose music.  I'd forgotten that when I was about 13 I had composed a mazurka, had gotten a scholarship to play the organ and had co-composed a choral piece that was performed when I was in high school.  I tried my hand again at composing with mixed results.  But I deepened and expanded my musical skills, learning a great deal from watching masterpieces you YouTube at musanim.com.  I finally learned how to practice correctly and gained a greater appreciation for the structure of the music that I had loved.  Experienced with passion always, now with a greater understanding of how the masters put their ideas together.  My struggle since childhood has been with depression.  i'm like a diabetic with my antidepressant.  Fortunately, my mood level is stable, unlike the shifting sugar levels diabetics have to navigate.

Now I teach adults to sing who can't even match a pitch when they start, who have been told that they can't sing.  I am convinced that anyone who enjoys listening to music can be taught to sing.

Every single child could eventually match pitch.  It remains one of the seminal moments of my life, and how sad it makes me when people tell children that they ""can\'t sing.""

When my husband was going through puberty and his voice was changing, a priest told him, ""Just mouth the words; don\'t sing.""  He shut up and wouldn\'t sing again till he met me, some 20 years later. It has been my experience, choir directors are usually pretty clueless on how the voice actually works.  All they seem to care about is making the sound blend.  That\'s why there\'s the current drive to make everyone sing straight tone -- so they don\'t have to deal with competing vibratos.  Very lazy approach, and it\'s hard on the singers who don\'t know how to do it correctly. The joy I see on people\'s faces when they finally open up and ""let it out"" is why I teach voice.

For 30 years I didn't sing; my vocal chords atrophied. And something important to me was simply missing.

I would still give a slight edge to a full-strength Warriors team to stop Kawhi's Spurs, but if Durant is at even a mere 75% I think Kawhi's team will be in the finals.  Kawhi bested LeBron in 2014. I know the fans of the Warriors would prefer to see them back in the finals but a Kawhi-LeBron rematch would be a basketball purist's dream come true. It's the Spurs who invented beautiful-game basketball, not the Warriors, and they remain it's best practitioners in my opinion. The Warriors have simply stacked their roster, they don't have the true efficiency or precision of the Spurs' system where seemingly mediocre players can become lethal threats and Kawhi has such an impact on defense that their opponents' best strategy is to stick his man in a corner and attempt to play 4 on 4."", ""The Warriors will not make it back to the finals.

He played for the US Olympic team and Coach K spoke well of him. I believe he was well worth the risk. Cousins might have carried any of the three Eastern contenders to the Championship.

As with other entitlements, we will soon find that the cost far exceeds the revenue and the 0.126% tax rate will have to be significantly raised or the state will have to cover the excess and raise other taxes. Consider the math: if we average one 12 week leave period per person per lifetime (an amount roughly consistent with the birth rate) at a payout of 70% of wages, the program would need to collect 16% of one year's wages (12 weeks/52 weeks/year * 70%) to cover the cost of that leave. This is only an approximation. Admin costs will increase that percentage, and whether leave is taken more toward the beginning or end of careers can either increase or decrease that percentage due to the time value of money and changes in earning power over the course of careers. But just considering total money in vs total money out, at 1/8% per year, a person would have to pay in to the system for 128 years to cover a single leave period. Since people work 40 to 50 years at best, there is no way a 0.126% deduction covers that one leave period.

Your experiences in the wine world are of equal interest as your keen point of view on the wine itself. I would enjoy hearing more about your daily 'behind the scenes' experiences from time to time in your column."", ""Any talk of putting an ingredients label on wine bottles? Not knowing what is in the stuff I've taken to drinking mostly organic and biodynamic wines. While this is mostly small labels, it includes names such as Giacomo Conterno.  I'm assuming that these people produce wines from grapes and minimal manipulation, but who knows? Ingredients labels seem like a good idea."", 'Wait, are you saying grapes are grown outdoors?', ""I live in the Minervois region of France, home to mostly family-owned wineries. One told me that spraying his vines would cost €4K--which could otherwise buy him a nice family vacation--so he wasn't going to do it unless absolutely necessary. Adding water, sugar, oak chips etc. is a big no-no. Many of the vats are made of concrete blocks, which insulate against temperature swings. And the barrels are oak. As OSS Architect says, a humble French table wine can eclipse California's science-driven wine. BTW, the winemakers, like most people around here, dress up for events."", ""None of this fancy widgetry will matter when the industry can't get their labor force across the border."", 'The University of California at Davis established a Viniculture Department in the early 70\'s. It introduced a scientific basis for growing grapes and making wine. US Prohibition wiped out the knowledge of traditional wine making brought over from Europe. So, in California at least, it was starting over from scratch. Learning where the right soils were; cloning European varietals that would work in California\'s climate. All vastly accelerated by the ""scientific approach"". Having focused on California wine for 40 years, I can say it\'s gotten better, but most importantly more consistent. Science Baby... but let\'s not forget a humble French Commune vin de table, made for generations, can eclipse it. One problem we can\'t seem to solve, organically, is how much alcohol is in the bottle. Initially California wine makers tried to make it a plus. Wine at 16-17% alcohol was marketed as ""Big"". Then we tried to disguise it with excess fruit. Cartoon wine, that made wine with food, like dinning with Super Heroes.  We still need better solutions to extracting excess alcohol from wine. Using a centrifuge is about the ""most organic"" but it has to have some effect on the structure of the wine (tannins, etc). Or we can wait until global climate change makes California unfit for wine making and move on North  to Oregon and Washington.', 'Wine is Big Business and when considering profit margins in a very competitive global industry that, unlike beer or spirits, only offers one chance per season to create the product for a successful business, this use of technology makes sense.  While I make natural wines at home for my own consumption, it would be too risky and ultimately a folly to do this on any large commercial scale (and no small boutique wineries can provide a living but are not large scale).', 'My favorite piece of wine equipment is the corkcsrew.', 'Good article. The right way to make wine is to bring good grapes into the winery and leave them alone, while monitoring them with more concentration than a helicopter parent.   And to have every available tech tool at your disposal for when (not if) something goes wrong. Dan Kravitz', 'While living in SF over 40 years ago, a group used to meet at a large retail store for tastings ponsored by large and small vintners.  Somebody said we should do our own tastings and pick our wines to taste.  Well I had a large home with plenty of the in the Marina district of SF.  That went well and then we wanted good food wh our wine.  Several of our group used to sell wine to restaurants and they strongly suggested having tastings on Tuesday evenings as that is the slowest night for them.  Then the Every Other Tuesday Night tasting group was formed and is still going today. fr Kermit Lynch was a member of that group but no longer as he has a large wine import company located in Oakland CA. Kermit has written a great book, Adventures on the Wine Route,  Kermit is extremely thorough about this business and visits French and other European locations to physically see how these vintners make their wine and maintain their vineyards.  Kermit\'s wines are frequently recommended by this NYT site.  Having been in the business for 3 years as marketing and sales manager for Sterling Vineyards, Kermit has written one hell of a book - Amazon has it for under $10.  LESEN as my Deutsch friends say!   Yes great wines are made in the vineyard - the vineyard people know when it will be a great year and tell the winemakers, ""Don\'t screw it up"" - in the vernacular.', 'Make no mistake, even the smallest family-run wineries use many of these tools. And more importantly, these tools DO make things simpler. Spraying prevents mold from overtaking grapes in the vineyard. Mechanized fruit sorting works BETTER than humans, and costs less. Adding yeast decreases your chance of stuck ferment. Filtering wine ensures that microbes don’t continue to grow in bottle. And I could go on and on. If you’ve ever encountered any of these situations while working in a winery, you know that tools to prevent them actually make things MORE simple, not less.', 'Simpler is better, but not when you are trying to make millions of bottles of $5.00 a bottle wine.', 'This report reminds me of the alleged last words of an old vintner to his heirs on his dying bed. This is what he said: ""I´m gonna tell you my last secret. You won´t believe it: You can make wine even from grapes!"" (This is an old ""Little Ice age"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age Carnival joke from Mosel area. The original wording is: ""Mr´kann uch us Druve Wing maache!"") Since 1960-70 this story is completely obsolete because of climate change. Without any doubt ""making wine from grapes"" is the cheapest way also for subprime vineyards. World famous top vineyards were never affected even In the coldest days (1895).']","Comments seem to be generally supportive and agree that technology has improved the wine industry with new processes and innovation, a few people say that simpler is better, but the overall consensus is that technology works.

I might defer to the wisdom of Mr. Wit as my experience is limited to reading Victor Cha\'s ""The Impossible State"" and absorbing the more scholarly articles and documentaries. Unfortunately, Kim Jong-un is the best example of ""riding a tiger"". If he stops or steps down to any degree the tiger will eat him. I\'m sure that that sea of goofy-hatted militarily we see Great Leader periodically address unanimously wishes him dead but for the fear of execution by anti-aircraft weaponry.      Plan A is working for Kim Jong-un. Plan B is a heavily fortified and stocked underground bunker to survive a nuclear holocaust (don\'t think for a moment such does not exist). Kim Jong-un knows that an inch of relenting will eventually open the doors to his populace learning they are starving and deprived. Such would tear him to pieces - literally.', 'The Trump Administration offers a range of diverse policy thinkers.

Tillerson—or deal with Trump.', 'Didn\'t Trump just reassure us that development of nuclear weapons a delivery system is ""not gonna happen""? So what surprises do the brains behind our foreign affairs, who all appear to be ideological idiots who think what they say goes everywhere in the world, have planned for the North Koreans? A pre-emptive nuke, no matter what those dishonest game-playing Chinese or Japanese or South Koreans have to say about it? Inquiring people want to know.', 'North Korea (DPRK) presents a very difficult policy problem for unilateral action by the US: North Korea has been propped up by China, and South Korea is vulnerable (particularly Seoul) to North Korean attack.   However the situation is not as bad as it seems, because China has every reason to fear its nuclearization, and is now making serious moves to rein-in the DPRK.  China just stopped coal imports from the DPRK -- that\'s serious.  In turn, for the first time ever, the state-controlled press is starting to criticize China. http://www.cfr.org/china/china-north-korea-relationship/p11097 """"China provides North Korea with most of its food and energy supplies and accounts for more than 70 percent of North Korea\'s total trade volume."" China\'s strategic goals have been clear: to keep North Korea as a buffer, avoid war on the peninsula.  The status quo had suited China well, until the DPRK started to nuclearize, and act more dangerously to China.  ""Acting more dangerously"" includes symptoms of collapse, and the recent assassination in Malaysia. North Korea had a famine, partly state engineered, that killed 2.4 million people in the 90s., 2015 was a drought year,  with very poor harvests.   North Korea is close to collapse.  Collapse of the DPRK has been widely forecast for years, and hasn\'t happened.  That does not mean it won\'t, particularly as pressures tighten.   The key to the DPRK, as always, is China.  And it looks like China is moving.', 'This reader wants to know what Mr. Wit thinks the U.S. should or could have done to get better behavior from North Korea over the past 25 years (or more).

Thank you for this information.  If true that employers use Equifax and other data collectors information which is private and confidential in violation of California State Law prohibiting employers from seeking information about an applicant's former employment - where when and how much then the State of California must sue Equifax with an injunction prohibiting any business operating in California, no matter where else situated, from doing business with any company that employs individuals working in the State of California.  It is ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA TO ASK FOR PAST WAGE OR COMPENSATION INFORMATION.  It is illegal in California to ask for conviction histories unless the type of crime for which the applicant was convicted, relates to the trust factor of the employee's job - ie a thief, fraud, embezzler has to fess up about his or her conviction to a prospective employer.   The transaction was noted on my credit report.  Lastly, where the stolen data goes is to India.  In India they sell information to dirty landlords, employers, etc. who use that data to harm their tenants and or employees.

It should be entirely illegal for any foreign national company to collect data on US Citizens their financial records if that citizen IS NOT DOING BUSINESS IN THAT COUNTRY As soon as I discovered this, that information disappeared from the internet view of my credit report.   However, I remember it and there is logic to it, and I will investigate to find out who abused my legal rights. If employers are using 3rd parties to collect, analyze, and report on information that a US cannot access under the Fair Credit laws of the US government, then we as the US have a lawsuit to file, an action against not only these companies but the people who use them. Companies in the US have a legal right to understand and know of the work history of an applicant, but not their wages, not in California.

Assume the dolts in today's congress can get anything at all done, and assuming that they actually hold the welfare of their constituents (you and me) above the influence of highly paid lobbyists, we ought to have a law that simply allows aggrieved consumers to sue these pariah credit bureaus and make them pay for their sloppiness with our personal data.

]","How YouTube’s biggest star took a bizarre career turn, and what it tells us about the nascent politics of social platforms.","['Felix draws a lot of inspiration from South Park, and his sense of humor is of the same style. His on-camera personality is very sarcastic and engages in self deprecation very often. His off-camera personality is extremely kind, hard working, and humble. As for his relationship with Youtube, most of his criticisms were shared by the majority of content creators when those videos came out. They weren\'t particularly associated with him or anyone in particular. He\'s not at all a radical person; he\'s actually very relaxed in his videos and avoids being serious. As for the fiver incident, he felt very bad and acknowledged that not only had the joke been of poor taste, but his action resulted in other content creators being banned. He helped them get started on a new platform, directly contributing $5000, although they were allowed back on fiver anyway. He feels that the media is attacking him because nearly every article seems to be critical and takes his sarcastic humor at face value. In my view, rather than an attack, it\'s more that the media seems to not understand his content. As a result, however, there is now a huge rift between content creators on Youtube and the so called ""mainstream media"". Most content creators, while acknowledging Felix\'s offensive humor, seem to agree that the articles have been, while not an attack, certainly a mischaracterization.', 'I was born in a wrong century and a wrong decade. Yet, I have my own personal apps a ""channel"" on YouTube that I call NEILTUBE. Still, I cannot understand these folks surfing youtube all day long looking at these videos.  No wonder, this young man could not see anything offensive, since his real contact is a pc and not a fellow human. To me, that\'s one problem with this generation.   For them, having a Web presence,  constantly checking messages etc - is a critical no, tje only part of living. Forget social interactions.  I wish they would just disengage themselves from pc - and ""smell"" the roses. I fear we are building a generation that is doomed to fail.', 'As an early ""YouTube scholar"" (I know, this may sound like the kind of laughable over-statement engaged by Kjellberg, but indeed, I have seriously researched, taught and written about YouTube for years, as have many others), my students, fellow scholars and I have long understood, as you convincingly argue, that YouTube self-reflexivity and ironic bigotry are definitive of the site: its users, uses, economies, and norms (see my born-digital ""video-book,""  Learning from YouTube, MIT Press, 2011.).  More recently, however, I have tried to make the link, that you also begin to draw so powerfully here, that these YouTube logics—of dark irony, corporate ownership, fakery and deception, and virality—have altered not just what is and is not permissible on YouTube but what might organize the internet and the political landscape it is now shaping (see my recent  JStore Daily, Nov. 30, 2016).  Thank you for illuminating commentary. Dr. Alexandra Juhasz, Chair, Film Dept., Brooklyn College, CUNY', 'Maybe I\'m just too far gone into my obsession with the Trump train wreck (certainly possible) but I can\'t help but hear echoes of that campaign: the class-traitor, the flirtation with racist memes, the mechanism of celebrity via social media, the attraction of a dedicated base of supporters who project their own emotions onto the ""star"" and - of course - the overweening ego.  Another data point, perhaps, that we live in times I no longer understand.  I\'ll wait to see if PewDiePie seeks to ""weaponize"" his celebrity by running for office or seeking some other platform for exploiting his position beyond the confines of YouTube.', 'This is basically a non-story. A lot of what you say here has been taken out of context and twisted for this story it seems to me. Kjellberg/PewDiePie\'s ""rants"" are nothing compared to the recent breakdowns of other YouTubers breakdowns like Tana Mongeau, Onision, or Marina Joyce. If you had bothered to watch the videos in their actual context that Kjellberg is, in fact, making fun of this type of so-called journalism. Come on guys. While you do have a good point in the fact that the neo Nazis are jumping on the bandwagon here, Kjellberg is NOT trying to subliminally brainwash people into normalizing alt-right and neo-nazi imagery, but he is just an easy target because he\'s the most subscribed person on the site. The claim about YouTube ""not being what it used to be"" was due to the massive amounts of glitches in recent months which were causing YouTubers to rapidly lose subscribers and viewers to constantly be unsubscribed to YouTube channels-- which was a LEGITIMATE ISSUE, not something Kjellberg ""claimed"". That was a legitimate fact, not an alternative one. There are legitimately awful people on the site, but you\'re going after the wrong target and, unfortunately, deepening the divide of trust between the media and the people. Please note I am not a Trump supporter nor do I believe in \'alternative facts\', but for YouTube, only two types of people truly understand it: those who actively create and those who consistently watch throughout the whole community.', ""I don't worry about pewdiepie becoming more altright but rather his fans. He has the largest audience on the platform and throughout his whole career he's had people criticize his videos because they were low quality content even though they are just supposed to be fun regardless of quality. I just recently became a pewdiepie viewer and I realized that the criticism wasn't really fair on him. This wasn't really that important when it was just people on the internet but with the new controversy, I've honestly begun to be disappointed with newspaper outlets like the wall street journal. It was just disappointing to see them get on the anti-pewdiepie train that he's always had to deal with and now I really have begun to wonder whether or not its fair journalism (and i'm really, really, liberal millennial) I'm trying to keep my trust in the media but, I don't really know anymore from these last couple of days."", ""Since when did making a joke place someone in the political spectrum. Assumptions are what started this mess and I can't see how the media still does not recognize this."", ""This article was incredibly insightful, and well researched. Thank you for truly caring about the context and facts, culture and jokes, irony, and even the nonchalant and inherent bigotry, that make YouTube what it is. This gave amazing detail and information without expressing an opinion or choosing a side. Unlike many articles I have seen recently, the slight click bait didn't push me away. Please keep up the good Journalism. We need more..."", 'Felix posted a video addressing this entire situation.  I recommend watching it as it is pretty clear that one he isn\'t anti-semitic.  And two the article in the Wall Street Journal is basically fabricated and takes every single ""anti-semitic"" thing he has done out of its proper context...', 'As well written and observant as I have found this article Mr. Herrman, I find that you have misunderstood what\'s actually going on here, but only by a little.   Felix has not politicized himself, the mainstream media has politicized him.  There would have been no reason to make fun and jab at the mainstream media, if they didn\'t point fingers and make political accusations at the drop of every hat. Also as far as the zeitgeist of ironic bigotry being ""worryingly instructive.""  It has become both ironic and okay to joke about because progressives have made the original concepts trivial.  As Anita Sarkeesian says: ""Everything is racist, everything is sexist, and everything is homophobic and you have to point it out."" Well sadly as most ideologically dogmatic liberals were clapping blindly at this sentiment.  They were also pointing it out, and as they pointed it out, they made topics of race, sex, and homosexuality, a lot more easy to joke about.  Why?  Because these same people started calling everyone racist, sexist, homophobes, and if everyone is, no one is.   Also if you read Vox on a regular basis you probably are worried about a lot of completely trivial things sane human beings shouldn\'t be scared of that\'s kind of their thing.   History isn\'t repeating itself, that\'s the conspiracy theory.  We aren\'t ""becoming nazis"" we are returning our generation\'s dialogue back to something more important than identity politics, which are facts.', 'Internet, so much hope for humanity, turned out to be a giant prostitution of the souls of individuals to ratings and individualized broadcast advertisement : idiocracy indeed.', 'I truly feel as though this media fight between various journals and the ""alternative media"" (mostly Youtube for this case) has gotten out of hand. The video was not hate speech, and anyone who watched the entire videos of those cited can see that it is not directed or meant to be directed in that manor. Additionally, PewDiePew apologized before everything blew up and again about an hour before this article was posted. As a distant consumer who very rarely uses Youtube I looked into these accusations (specifically WSJ\'s article) and found them to be completely unfounded. Could Felix of been more PC? Definitely, but that\'s not what his form of media is about, he seems to find comedy in extreme satire and unless you see a problem with satire I see no way in which someone can say he is supporting the Alt-right movement in anyway. Hold him to the same accountability of the Onion if you find it hard to see him as a new form of media in this situation.', ""John Herrman seems to have missed the mark with this one, with his dated commentary on Kjellberg's work overlooking a thoroughly explained tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that Kjellberg himself tends to overtly state throughout his videos.   This piece is the product of someone doing surface-level research and it shows which is really disappointing because until today, the NYT was running on a 100% hit rate for me."", 'I read a fair amount of articles and writings on this subject, but this is the first to make me wonder what I just read. Your point is vague and unclear and you trying to dance around the subject just leaves the reader, whatever his or her perspective on this may be, frustrated.  Also for an article concerned with self-perception and image, this article is ironically devoid of any introspection of how the media covers entertainers like Felix.', ""Have you all drunk gas? I'm honestly appalled that your publication would purposefully misinterpret comedy for the purpose of scare-mongering, and endorsing the destruction of a person's livelihood because you don't like his style of humor is simply disgusting."", 'I\'m not a huge fan of PewDiePie, but there is such a thing as satire and irony.  His antics aren\'t even remotely similar to the alt-right goons. To watch these videos and claim otherwise is to engage in willful, tendentious misreading. He\'s an internet goofball, caught in the crosshairs of people looking to be outraged.  This is similar to the controversy in which Stephen Colbert satirized conservatives for engaging in crude ethnic stereotypes of asians; this satire was then criticized (by an asian activist) as reinforcing crude ethnic stereotypes. She called for Colbert\'s show to be cancelled, making the same dumb argument we see here: ""even if it\'s humor, it is a weapon used against minorities."" It made no sense then, and makes no sense now. I urge anyone who is worried about the state of our culture - especially about the coarsening of public discourse - to actually watch the videos instead of reading this hit piece.', 'The agony of the holocaust and a few other horrors wrought by humanity (lynchings, slavery, terrorism to name a few) will never be fodder for satire, no matter the point it attempts to make. Kjellberg found this our swiftly and painfully.', 'you can never take anything far enough...just dont sell out...no copyright ever forever...these politically correct times are one big reality show...like in unreal...its all about tie-ins, advertising SEND MONEY ...and anything can be turned around, so man start your own deal...but dont sell out this time...stay true. And dont believe anything but Yourself and be sure to have a muse. vachelettres. NO to media mafia exploitation and rape of media mafia pop stars. NEVER WATCHED ANY OF YOUR VIDEOS NOR YOUR YOUTUBE which are prolly  lame. but hey you live love and learn. Now go something cool.', 'The Wall Street Journal article is pure farce. They blantantly take Pedwdiepie snippets out of context with the ultimate end goal of getting more clicks to their site by attacking the most famous Youtuber. When young people see this they will start to mistrust mainstream media and that will in the end be the biggest outcome of this. WSJ has done themselves and the mainstream media in large a huge disservice.', 'All of this hysteria coming from the left over supposed Nazi stormtrooper Youtube personalities reminds me of the religious right in the 90s kvetching over Satanic heavy metal and rap music.', 'It wasn\'t ""Death to all Jews"". It said ""Death to all Jews, subscribe to Keemstar"". The joke is that Keemstar is a well known YouTube troll that has said racial slurs in the past. Watch from 4:05 of the following video and it proves that the WSJ taken every single joke completely out of context. Felix should totally take them to court. https://youtu.be/JLNSiFrS3n4?t=245', 'Finally, someone intelligent wrote it right. Thank you for committing yourself to the whole story.', ""Felix Kjellberg a.k.a. PewDiePie may look like an anti-semite and talk like an anti-semite but don't let that fool you. He really is an anti-semite."", 'Let\'s not get to ""out there"" on PewDiePie.  Okay, he\'s crazy.  Brace yourself for a shock, he\'s always been crazy.  As with many other creators on YouTube, and many other people working at Citibank.  Citibank does not fire then, generally.  This is a necessary component of a broad work force, within reason, at YouTube and Citibank.  So, does this blow-up really matter all that much.  I don\'t think so.

A surprise is that Mary Leakey was actually a smoker and a drinker and had quite the bold attitude and that’s surprising because I usually think of paleoanthropologist as quiet solemn people who enjoy spending their time studying the simple, but very important parts of human life – its history. A message that this video provides is that great things can come from strange and random places and as long as you are enjoying yourself, you will find your great thing.', 'This film talks about a paleoanthropologist named Mary Leakey. Mary Leakey discovered footprints of human ancestors on the African Savanna, thanks to her intelligence. Mary Leakey inspired people to be who they are. Mary Leakey was able to change how the world is today. Today her history is still remembered. Working in the field of work, Mary Leakey was able to go to the past and find the footprints. This shows that with simple evidence and common sense we are able to know the paths of our ancestors. Mary Leakey also had a lot of patience, which gave her the results she expected.', ""this documentary was very interesting because it talked of Mary Leakey's discoveries of the human ancestor. the moment that stood out for me was when she had discovered the footprints of our ancestors. this really surprised me because i did not know that humans looked that way or that you could even find their foot print. i am glad that there is people who are actually out there finding out more things about humans cause there is so much more we can learn."", 'This film shows how dedicated Mary Leakey was in finding historical evidence that involved the discovery of human footprints. Mary Leakey was a famous paleoanthropologist that would always work hard and she never gave up until she was satisfied with what she found that day. Mary was unique because there were very few female scientists during this time but that didn’t stop her from continuing her passion. She was one of the first to use a different type of method when looking for the discovery of early human ancestors. An elephant dung fight led to the discovery of a fossilized animal print, which goes to show that discoveries could happen at the least expected moment.', ""This film opens up our eyes and suprises uswith the things we usually don't think about where they came from. This film gives us the history of our knowledge. Why do we know the things that we know today? well the reason for that is because of the fact that many people( scientist) were curious about many things and whent out to dicover the things that they did not know. It is such a surprize to see where and how far that science had come from. From not knowing much at all to having access to books and research available to us for almost all the questions that we have. A message that can be taken from this film is that Curiosity is why knowledge exsist and it is the building block of our exsistence."", 'As someone who finds most aspects of science very interesting, this video not only serves as an example of determination, but it also informed me about where all of our ancestors came from and how they walked. This film is about Mary Leakey, a famous anthropologist who was dedicated to her work of digging to unlock the secrets of the human’s ancestors. Hs was a dedicated woman and even searched for two years before finding the footprints. This shows that dedication truly pays off if you are able to be patient. As long as you are dedicated and patient, good things might come to you.', 'I agree with you on this. These scientist really wanted to know how we humans canme about and they did everything in their power to conduct envestigations and prove to the world that their is more. They knew that their was something beyond our knowlegde and they went to chase history down to fufill their curiosity and redeem the knowledge that was unknow to human kind for such a long time.

The film tells stories about her love for her dogs. Many people want to know the history behind humans. Majority of the people around the world ask many questions related to who was the first human? How were humans created in a world where scientists once said their was no living things?  How did they survive many years?  Mary Leakey had similar questions, but unlike those people Mary Leakey took action, she and Luis Leakey her husband set of to Africa. Luis Leakey and Mary Leakey were a great team while Luis Leakey sponsored is wife. Mary Leakey ancient artifacts, such as her great discovery of human ancestors footprints on the Africa savanna. Mary Leakey contributed in the discoveries of Paranthropus Boisei (1959) and Homo Habilis (1964). Mary and Luis Leakey\'s determination to search for answers of our human history allows people to become one step closer to finally figuring out our Human history. To add on  Mary Leakey is an inspiration to anyone scientist in the world.', 'I agree that Mary Leakey and her work is very inspiring, she spend a lot of time in uncomfortable places like the African Savanna under the sun trying to complete her goals and contribute to our knowledge of human origin or ancestry. She and her husband, Louis Leakey, discovered many ancient artifacts or remains. I was surprised at how much she loved her dogs, she give them butter even though they are rationing some of their foods. Her discovery of the footprints which show when human ancestor began walking on two leg was a result of her determination, this discovery allow human to better understand their origin.', 'I thought that this weeks film was very interesting. It was about a paleoanthropologist named Mary Leakey who was looking for human origin and past human events and bone structure. She is a very dedicated worker, sometimes taking several months, even years to finish a project. We saw this as she spent 2 years looking and finding a footprint, which shows how dedicated and determined she is.', 'I agree with you about Mary Leakey being a very dedicated person when it came to her projects. She spent so much time trying to find information that could lead to a discovery of a human or animal fossil. No matter how long it took to find some sort of evidence, Mary would keep on looking. It showed us how much she loved doing this, not to mention that she was one of very few people to look for these fossils and artifacts. After all this time, Mary finally found a fossilized animal footprint and it showed me that hard work pays off.', 'You are so right she is a very hard worker, taking that much just to study the snippet of the things that occurred such a long time ago is wonderful. She is such a great figure, one that is unfortunately not celebrated enough. Like many other hidden people that work behind the scenes to create the lives that we have today and to also help us to understand our own origins and make up better.

She was dedicated to her work, using careful methods to dig up remains and she was very determined to find out about human origin. Mary and her husband greatly contributed to the search and found many remains of human ancestors. She discovered track from bipedal human ancestor that is preserved with volcanic ash. The moment that stood out to me was when it took her two years to find the footprint because it show how much time she have to put into her work and how devoted she is to her goals. A message you can take away from this film is that people have to stick to their goals and work hard in order to achieve anything.', 'I too believe that she contributed to the scientific community because of her discovery, especially since this discovery proves that the Laetoli people walked on two feet, like us. I cannot believe that she spent two years searching for this tracks. If it were mean I would have given up because I would have lost hope. Not only did she not lose her hope but she stayed determined through the hardships she must have encountered.

I don't know what they do, but I remember reading an article about a female high endurance athlete who had a team of people helping her survive what looks so wonderful to us and yet is very painful for the athletes.

My massage therapist used to work with pro atheletes and musicians and the stories she tells are grueling. I myself take a Tylenol when the pain keeps me awake. Yoga, massage, and chiropractic help a lot."", 'Perhaps the use of antioxidants for relief of muscle pain after exercise is misguided.  Basic cell biology tells us the muscle cell depends on mitochondrial function for energy production, and lactate build up causes muscle pain. Supplements like Coenzyme Q-10, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Carnitine and Benfothiamine enhance mitochondrial function by improving oxidative phosphorylation and transfer of electrons in the electron transport chain (ETC).  Use mitochondrial energy supplements instead of anti-oxidants for better muscle function and less pain.  Alternately, drugs which inhibit mitochondrial function such as statins which deplete CoQ10, and Metformin which inhibits Complex I of the electron transport chain, will make muscle pain worse.  Some antibiotics such as tetracycline, and erythromycin inhibit mitochondrial function because mitochondria share many of the same energy pathways as bacteria.

Lester Packer\'s book, \'Miracle of Antioxidants\' (C) 1999 reports that vitamin E improved running, but not swimming, performance. More recent work reviewed by NYTs, shows that taking antioxidants prior exercise, decreases the extent to which the exercise fortifies the body. An individual\'s response to use of antioxidants can vary relative to their state of health -- when my body was very much systemically inflamed, antioxidants were a healing lifesaver. As my health improved, the benefit of antioxidants waned. *    * Taking \'omega 3\' polyunsaturated dietary oils (from flax/fish) can enable dramatic improvements in soft-tissue healing. However, these oils are much more prone to oxidation in the body than the saturated fat in dairy. Therefore, it is possible that eating polyunsaturated fats can cause such oxidation, and promote reactions such as ""accelerated aging"" or ""cancers"". The cure for that is to also take a little vitamin E, which functions to prevent lipid peroxidation.  {For two years i took omega 3 fats without vitamin E, and during/after my running i felt exhausted, and looked like i was dying much faster than planned.

I learned to be grateful that those owners brought their pets in to the shelter. It was far better in there than dumped outdoors to a more horrific doom. It was better at the shelter because those dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, etc. were treated with love and compassion. Sometimes for the first time.

]","It’s no surprise that adolescents find handy, if sometimes quirky, ways to reset when they are feeling overwhelmed.","['""But what about when teenagers face stressors that defy straightforward solutions, such as unrelenting school or social pressures?"" What if the stresses come from the parents themselves? Not all parents want to understand their children or take the children\'s concerns seriously. As for parents\' choosing the children\'s coping mechanisms, rather than letting them choose a non-destructive coping mechanism for themselves, that\'s a recipe for more stress.', 'My 17 year old has been listening to Disney soundtracks and singing at the top of her lungs.  It makes me smile.', ""This is the best insight into teens I've read in a very long time. Fits my HS freshman and senior to a tee. And, to be honest, me. We watch/read Harry Potter over and over and over."", ""Teenagers: a made-up category. The realty is that we are first children and then adults. Teenagers are just people that parents, schools and the workforce are not allowing to be grownups. And then 'riff off of', as in this article. It's a cottage industry. This infantilization of the 2nd decade of life ensued because education prolonged dependency beyond puberty. But now there should be a social category, the 'young adult' for age 14 and over. Their responsibiities should include academic performance, and real work not to exceed 15 hours a week or three sessions. Their rights include having their own time & space with no interference after meeting their responsibilities. Some youngsters might continue to behave like overgrown children and make growing up ambivalent & neurotic, but most will reach for the status of young adulthood with pleasure; energized. And recognized. Society has no greater imbalance than insisting that people remain children for nearly a decade after puberty. It goes against nature and has affected and infected society for 4 generations. Enough! Let us grow up about children growing up. Finally, the issue with education, its intractability to real improvement, also stems from having misconceived growing up. For the educational system needs to mirror growing up, if it is to work. Late middle school and high school are such a mess because pupils are placed in the impossible situation of having to behave like children when they are really young adults."", 'You have some good points.  However, I think you would benefit from reading up on the research into adolescent brain development that has emerged over the past decade.  There are distinct differences between teenagers and adults.   So while I think that middle and high schools might do a better job in some areas, It is my opinion that as parents and as educators, we do not make a big enough distinction between teenagers and adults.  Teenagers might benefit from more freedom, but they still require an enormous amount of guidance.  As a school counselor, I believe one of the biggest mistakes parents can make is thinking that their job is ""done"" once their child starts looking like an adult.', ""I think your point is valid. But note that I propose a different category from 'adult', that is, 'young adult'; and certainly there shoudl be evidenced-based consideration of what the age group needs and can handle. Also, guidance is fine as long as there is not an in-built bias toward retarding growth, as so often happens. Sexual energy, in particular, comes to the individual gradually and should be channelled gradually into love and also into converting into something that we call, for want of a better word, 'spiritual energy'. The techniques were known in India and China and have been pretty much lost or distorted. What should not happpen with sexuality is degradation in the midst of repression, and then violent release. This is becoming commonplace and embodies the downward spiral of civilization just now. FInally, I believe freedom comes after basic obligatons have been met, not instead of obligations. My basic viewpoint is that society cannot afford the waste of not converting children into adults efficiently. Successful civilizations and tribes have always done this, and it is a pivotal achievement."", 'As a latch key kid I can give a heavy vote for Three Stooges, which I watched on WGN every afternoon. Other than the Marx Brothers, nothing has come close to solving those adolescent migivings, or prepared me better for life.', 'My dad would have oldies radio playing in the car when I was a girl growing up. When I became a teen I discovered his crate of albums - Motown and The Beach Boys was my soothing soundtrack.', ""Who are these parents who are surprised that their teens turn to younger pleasures to relax?  Why is anyone surprised?  This is a very common pattern for many people. I still love to re read the books I devoured in my adolescence, children's adventure stories,  or classics like Jane Eyre, or traditional Indian stories. And I am in my 50s. Just like people like to listen again and again to a favorite piece of music, you get the same pleasure from re reading a favorite book. Same for a movie or TV show I guess, for the wired generation (though the neural connections for reading are much richer than for the passive pleasures of media consumption)."", ""I'm a 33 year old, Ivy League educated surgeon, but I still de-stress with cartoons and comic books. The older I get, the less apologetic I am about my love of cartoons. It isn't about nostalgia for me, because I didn't watch cartoons or read comics as a kid, it's about escape and replay value. Cartoons are far enough away from my life to completely disconnect me from what I'm watching, and they have a high replay value by design. Unlike the shows of my childhood, they are well made too (both Avatar series, Rick & Morty, etc)."", 'The movie Spring Breakers depicts this when they take a break from drinking, drugs etc to watch My Little Pony', ""Destress...hah. It's called having fun."", 'Winnie the Pooh is the most comforting movie for my college-age kid. My high schooler tends to decompress watching Lilo and Stitch.

I did ask my daughter and she just said the songs made her feel happy!"", ""I like to decompress with Disney movies and stupid shows too, and I'm in my 30s! These strategies help and are used by adults, too, not just adolescents. Which can help the adolescents even more - seeing that they're not the only ones with problems, that stress is part of everybody's life and that we all have our ways to deal with it. They can borrow from their parents' strategies or be inspired to try their own. Or if parent and teen find they share the same strategy, they can do it together and add some quality time together as a bonus! My kids are still too young for that, but I can totally see us laughing over stupid cat videos together when the pressure gets too high.""]","Many commenters support this coping mechanism, at least in a general sense, for themselves or their children and speak about resorting to childhood pleasures when stressed.

It begins: ""Take up the White Man\'s burden,/ Send forth the best ye breed/  Go bind your sons to exile,/ to serve your captives\' need;/ To wait in heavy harness,/ On fluttered folk and wild—/ Your new-caught, sullen peoples,/ Half-devil and half-child"" ... And later in the verses, Kipling famously entreats America not to ""call too loud on Freedom To cloak your weariness ..."" Colonialism and imperialism as the noblesse oblige of the white race? Not surprisingly, Kipling\'s poem and its dreadful sentiments were soundly criticized in their time. Political cartoonist William H. Walker drew an especially sharp satire for Life magazine showing huge Uncle Sam, John Bull and Kaiser figures being carried by struggling blacks, with the subtitle ""The White (?) Man\'s Burden.""', 'Anything by Kipling. I love his poems and still read Just So Stories.', 'what we still have and are some thought it all in the past that epic battle of civilizations anyone you might stop to ask modern in our civilized nations we treat everyone with equality no discrimination racial shame that is our one defining quality what if some don’t do the same what if old religions still conspire to dominate where freedom lives use the torturous sword terror fire where a good person still forgives political refugee before it’s too late your country where honesty thrives to emigrate infiltrate not assimilate from their failed societies bitter lives whose land despoiled beyond repair breeds uncontrolled victims of nature those with cultures surviving to share can only help those creating a future with the hand of friendship extended decency offers the gift of democracy but wherever the deceit never ended forgive cut them loose if ungracefully', 'Kipling\'s ""Epitaphs of the War"" are also worth reading. They\'re very brief, and the best of them are written with a powerful blend of clarity, bitterness and compassion. Some examples:  COMMON FORM If any question why we died, Tell them, because our fathers lied. THE BEGINNER On the first hour of my first day     In the front trench I fell. (Children in boxes at a play     Stand up to watch it well.) THE COWARD I could not look on Death, which being known, Men led me to him, blindfold and alone. The last one is engraved on a Belgian memorial for WWI soldiers shot for cowardice. And then there is the epitaph ""A Dead Statesman,"" which I have treasured up in my mind for the day when it will be appropriate to apply it to George W. Bush. I could not dig: I dared not rob: Therefore I lied to please the mob. Now all my lies are proved untrue And I must face the men I slew. What tale shall serve me here among Mine angry and defrauded young?', 'There is another epitaph he wrote after the war. If anyone questions why we died, Tell him, because our fathers lied.', 'He\'s much better than a ""blustery champion"" - a very fine, and very accessible, poet and novelist.', 'Two points:  First I hazard a guess that the modernists (for example, Eliot dismissing Kipling as a ""writer of verse"" were actually more offended by the emotions and sentiments Kipling he portrayed than the forms he employed. Kipling was above all sentimental; and this is an area of feeling that was pronounced taboo by modernist and post modernist alike.  It is ironic that what was ostensibly a voice for freedom demanded an inhibition of part of the human spectrum as the Victorians did for sexuality. Chacun son prohibition.  Moderns are actually a quite emotionally inhibited lot.     Second, in much of Kipling\'s poetry -and prose too - there is a powerful subversion of the manifest jingoism and racism.  Think Gunga Din and East and West.  As in many works, the Kipling of racism and jingoism actually  shows the oriental to be the superior person.']","Several commenters love Kipling's poetry and find his work accessible and sentimental.

]","Michelle Goldberg reviews McGowan’s memoir, a cautionary tale about the entertainment industry by the actress who accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault last fall.","[""By being 'one of the first women to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault', Ms. McGowan is a whistleblower on Hollywood, good for her.  If only the Hollywood legends such as Meryl Streep, who undeservedly are being fawned over with #MeToo, had been so brave,  Streep is an outspoken moralizer yet is a total hypocrite who 1. gave confirmed child rapist Roman Polanski a standing ovation at the 2003 Oscars and 2. worked with and made tons of money from the monster Weinstein for years, and irreverently and offensively referred to him as God, even though his abominable reputation was an open secret in all of Hollywood. One would think that the complicity and enabling and support of these deplorable men would result in humility and self-reflection, but one would be sadly mistaken. Streep has not apologized at all for this unconscionable support and endorsement, but instead has doubled down and deflects by attacking those with whom she disagrees politically. It is refreshing that Ms McGowan has exposed Hollywood for what it is, and people's eyes have become open, that Hollywood is worse than a cult, and that very few Hollywood actors/actresses deserve the podium that they all are still standing on."", ""I don't know if your book is well-written or not, and I don't really care. You found the courage and the voice to start a landslide, one that would end up taking down an army of smug, protected creeps who thought they'd never have to face the music. Thank you for being brave."", 'The Affleck men need to be driven from Hollywood and never work again.Casey Affleck is a predator and Ben Affleck is a weak man with no integrity. Rose McGown is incredibly brave. Thank you, Rose.', 'The thing that\'s really confusing about all of this is that Rose McGowan was known for displaying her body both on-screen and off.  She was, to put it simply, a sex symbol.  So....why did she do that?  Not that in any way she ""deserved"" to be assaulted -- no one does.  But why make a career of displaying your body when it would seem that that is part and parcel of the culture she despises?', ""I really like her and I want her to stay strong, keep her Rose Army movement going. She's very inspiring. The only problem I have in reading this and I guess I'll have to buy the book is that it would appear she didn't say no to Weinstein? Why not? Why can women not say no? And then coupled that with feigned pleasure? I understand she's telling the truth and she should not be derailed or demoralized for that but I also think women need to say no. If your career matters more than saying no, I think maybe that's on you because you aren't serving other women by playing along. Otherwise, it sounds like a great book. I think I'll buy it."", 'Rose McGowan -  hero.', 'What an expert cashing in of victimhood, the American way. She also has a tie-in  reality series on E. For her cash seems to be the revenge. Had she forgone the cash in 1997, may be 20 years worth of sexual attacks by Weinstein could have been stopped.', 'Oh, also a way for some celebrity. A cheap one though, and not particularly intelligent. Any other way of earning the living, lady?', 'Only of the many women the rapacious Mr Weinstein left in his wake. No one should have that kind of power.', ""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/business/metoo-finance-lawsuits-haras... There's always a buck to make in America for someone else's misery. We are so exceptional."", 'Yes, Rose McGowan does come across as a bit ""unhinged"". As I think I would be if I had endured all that she has. She has done a great service to the world - I only wish she had been believed earlier.', 'Sorry, ""brave"" women do not accept hush money, only to tweet about their abuses 20 years later.  Think about the women who might have been spared these abuses had she *actually* been brave and reported him to the police that very night.', 'No woman (or man) should ever be subjected to the abuse Harvey foisted on her. One hopes that he will die in prison for the crimes he has committed. But, yes, it is a bit much to read how she ""suffered"" by having to work on a less than intellectually-stimulating hit TV series which I assume was very lucrative. Plenty of people cleaning apartments and working in fast food would love to suffer similarly.  Ms. McGowan could be a potent advocate for women and men everywhere. She must not allow herself to be distracted by the trivial which will only diminish her efficacy.', 'I liked the article and also really like the writer.  I believe she was on Bill Maher the other night and she as the best panelist I’ve heard.  Particularly discussing Israel and Jerusalem with .  Love it when she told him to go see it for himself!  I’d like to tell her how much I learned and enjoyed that exchange.  NY Times,  you have the best staff.  Bravo!', 'I\'m appalled by Rose McGowan\'s story and I\'m glad that she\'s found her voice. Speaking the truth as she knows it is her right and I don\'t object to it. I find it very cruel and hypocritical of the Time\'s Up movement that they do not acknowledge her.  However I find statements like the following: “Your entertainment comes at a cost to us performers...You should know this and acknowledge.” to be misguided and ridiculous. No one forced McGowan into show business- she stayed because she wanted to stay. At any point in her journey, she could very well have simply said, ""I\'m out"" and gone off to some other job elsewhere. If she felt ""robbed"" that she had to get married on television before her real wedding, then she just doesn\'t understand that as an actress, she gets to pretend for a living and that\'s the extent of it. The marriage episode on ""Charmed"" can hardly be equated to what happened to Maria Schneider on the set of ""Last Tango in Paris"". My take-away from this article (and let me be clear- this is placing the Weinstein-matter firmly to the side to consider the rest of the piece) is McGowan\'s overwhelming bitterness at the superficiality of her career. What happened to her is monstrous. But her decision to stay put and plug away in Hollywood is a choice too and that\'s a fact.', ""Having worked in the entertainment industry, the amount of misogyny and sexual harassment is overwhelming.  It is ludicrous to avoid this reality or to attempt to deny it. Rose McGowen is a hero for standing up for herself and telling the truth and for having the courage to deal with the onslaught of hatred flung her way in defense of the indefensible.  While it isn't easy to deal with the almost daily revelations regarding the sexual misconduct of certain celebrities, it is the unknown, less cared about women in the trenches with whom I am most concerned. It is our duty to ensure our daughters, and their daughters, have a life free from the strife of sexual harassment or misconduct, rape, or abuse, and that we provide a climate of trust, equality and fairness.  Neither sex has a right to sexual gratification from an unwilling, or coerced partner or participant."", 'I read stories like this and feel a level of anger that is surely unhealthy.  More than anything else, I want to do something.  How do we stop this predation?  My best thought is (non-monstrous) men and women working together to identify these monsters; women pointing the men towards the monsters, who are otherwise too often too visible to women and too invisible to us men; men, both with and without women, intervening to discipline and punish at every level along a spectrum from informality ""don\'t work with that guy, ever, until he admits what he\'s done and makes amends"" to full criminal sanctions and hard jail time.  I feel strongly this is a man\'s problem; it is we men who are letting down our sisters through our laziness, ambition and complicity. Evidentiary requirements prevent serious criminal sanctions based on unsubstantiated allegations, no matter how frequent, but we can boycott, exile, providing damning opinions, and refuse to participate, much less enable, and provide all the support we can to \'just say no\' when a monster calls a young woman to his suite.', 'Excellent review. I can’t wait to read Brave.', ""McGowan's role as a leadership figure is complex and problematic. She herself is no paragon of virtue - when she first became prominent in the Weinstein saga, I found myself recalling her destructive dalliance with Robert Rodriguez. The movement needs compelling figures to propel it forward. McGowan's tendencies and conduct have helped make her more of a persona that people want to recoil from rather than gravitate toward. She is not helping the cause in a way that best suits the needs of the cause. When someone has only one behavioral volume level, cannot manage their anger, consistently mentions how horrible everything is, and is diligent about naming all the causes of their misery (which are always external), to me, that is a clear sign that the diagnostic manual needs to be consulted."", 'I feel some trepidation about McGowan\'s book, because I know that when a victim isn\'t ""perfect"" people will use that as an excuse to disbelieve or discount her.  The thing is, while probably a lot of people will find McGowan grandiose and dramatic in an off-putting way (as I do, calling one\'s autobiography ""Brave"" is fairly narcissistic) - so what?  Weinstein et al aren\'t only going to attack ""perfect"" women.  The very fact that I worry in any way about the perception of her character is part of the problem.  Any woman can be victimized, whether you like her or not.  I am glad Michelle Goldberg wrote about this book in a way that says while McGowan may be ""a bit much,"" she is honest and compelling and has told a story that matters for women and girls.  She is brave.', 'After reading this review for the book it makes me wonder if she ever had a chance at a normal life. Everything she experienced comes across like something from a Charles Dickens Novel.', 'I have a whole lot of respect for Rose McGowan. Reflecting on her statement ""Your entertainment comes at a cost to us performers. You should know this and acknowledge..."" - every day I face teens at an inner city school, and it comes at a cost to me - the constant challenge of keeping students engaged, the stress of the job, the attitudes.. But that is the job, one which I am privileged to have. I am satisfied with the work I do, and the downsides are part of it. Every job has costs, perhaps we should all acknowledge each others\' efforts a little more, and be kinder to one another.', 'You know as a man reading all these accounts has been very eye opening. I can see easily before how difficult it must have been for women facing these situations alone. The word Patriarchy is a good one. Well done Rose. Good on you.', 'Around 2009 or so, when all around me feared layoffs and the potential loss of their homes and dreams, I was counseled at work that, above all, the organization prized ""being nice"".  This meant going along with the crowd with a smile on one\'s face regardless of rule breaking, ethical violations by our superiors, requests to be party to intimidation, and verbal and emotional abuse by supervisors.  Never in my professional life had I experienced these types of behaviors.  I guess I was lucky until then, but I could not partake in that charade - and of course I was deemed the problem: angry, strident.  I got ""written up""!  Knowing that I was not clever enough to fool virtually all my co-workers and supervisors up until joining that organization I sought out the EAP to shore up my coping skills and come up with a plan for my next career steps.  The most helpful aspect of that move was when the EAP assured me that I had plenty of company within my organization, which was unlikely to change. I carried out a successful escape, facilitated by my spouse, who was equally dissatisfied in the same organization.  It involved relocation, more education, the loss of our home, and other disruptions, but nearly a decade later we both feel we are on a more solid footing, financially and professionally.  Gaslighting leaves scares though.  I don\'t trust others as I once did, waste hours questioning my own competency, and nearly tear up at mostly glowing work reviews.  I wish Rose the best.']","Commentators say that Rose McGowan has the right to tell her story, but that she cannot say that she has had a painful life because she chose to continue working in Hollywood.

Does anyone really think that a bear wants to ride bike? If you do, take a moment to look into the eyes of that bear.  You will see fear, loneliness and despair. There was a recent report of a bear who was so traumatized while doing a stand up trick, that he urinated on himself.  Imagine his degradation. Circus animals are kept chained to concrete floors and fed spoiled meat.  They are transported in trucks or trains with very little air during all kinds of weather. Sometimes their babies are trampled. The best description I can recall is that of Dumbo being ripped from his mother's trunk.  He was too young to know the lessons of torture that his Mother knew only too well. Please, the only circus worth any sentiment is one without animals.

Once the circus began to travel by train, the old circus wagons were discarded and used on farms to haul hay, corn and livestock. However, many wagons have been returned to Circus World Museum and restored to their original glamour.

,There is something powerful about attending an institution that was built for you.,"[""There is only one surviving DNA genetic evolutionary fit multicolored human race species that began in Southeast Africa 250,000 years ago.   Color is not race. Color is a chronological ecological isolation response to varying levels of solar radiation at different altitudes and latitudes related to Vitamin D production and protecting genes from damaging mutations. But about 2-5% of Europeans and Asians carry the primitive genetic racial heritage of their Neanderthal and Deovisan ancestors. That is the only bi-racial human survival.  There is none of that genetic heritage in the first and most ancient modern humans in Sub-Saharan Africa. Color as a racial marker is a legacy of the white supremacist American history that denied Africans their humanity as enslaved persons and their equality as Americans during the Jim Crow era and it's aftermath. My paternal great grandfather, who was born enslaved in Georgia, graduated from Atlanta Baptist College aka Morehouse.  His eldest son and my grandfather was an alumni of Shaw University.  My grandmother was the daughter of two enslaved Georgians who sent her to finish college at Atlanta University. My maternal great grandfather was born free in South Carolina and finished college at a South Carolina HBCU. I did not attend an HBCU undergrad nor grad nor professional school as I came of college age in the wake of the late 1960's civil rights era."", 'Human biological differences played a huge rule in black slavery: sub-Saharan Africans have a high incidence of resistance to malaria, and were thus imported to replace dying white indentured servants and Indians.  http://www.malaria.com/blog/american-plasmodium-vivax', 'Integration policies today were initiated by white American legislators in the 1960-1970s protest era against legal racial discrimination. The policies were well-intended, without which we would probably not have made so much progress in freeing black Americans from the oppressive legal shackles of institutional white supremacy. For one consequence was a foreign policy against white South African and British inspired racist laws there. But black colleges and universities have developed an alumni and role unparalleled in developing a black middle-class. And we see brilliant results in the graduates working in our increasingly integrated society. Xavier University in New Orleans, Meharry and Howard are the leading producers of black medical doctors and researchers. The reason is that most white colleges and universities still select black students to fill racial-ethnic percentage quotas, or collegiate sports programs, while working to marginalized HBCUs which do not have that burden and can actually select students based on ability. What irony! Long live the HBCUs and the Black Churches! They are the American historical evidence of things no longer seen. They are the truth.', ""More than fifty years after school integration some black folks decide they really don't like attending school with whites after all. Great."", 'I had a similar experience attending a school system where I received a great education but their were very few that students that looked like me.  I too had the opportunity to go to Ivey League schools or play football.  I chose Morehouse College for undergraduate school and Howard U. for graduate school.  Particularly, at Morehouse we were taught that \'more"" was expected of us as graduates.  We were there to become leaders and change the world.

Most colleges were built for white students, or at least, with only white students in mind."" What was that we were taught about race just being a ""social construct"", only of importance to racists and white supremacists? Here is a black person telling us just how important race is. Clearly, not for the reasons that racial supremacist believe it is, but because central to any deep and meaningful sense of both personal and group identity. This doesn\'t just apply to black people like Skylar Mitchell, but to ALL people, including white people. Why is there this insane insistence (especially amongst academics) that race doesn\'t, or shouldn\'t matter, when it so obviously does? It is, I believe an overreaction to Jim Crow and even more to Nazism and the Holocaust.  The Nazi\'s criminally insane racial ideology made a big ugly thing of race, where it really was just a social construct amongst the closely related peoples (including Jews) of Europe. In overreaction to this, academics (esp. Jewish academics who were personally traumatised by the Holocaust) went to the opposite extreme of denying the importance - even the very existence - of race altogether.', 'Roger Hicks, UK: British folks generally miss the significance of our Constitution\'s individual equal rights requirement regardless of class, religion, ethnicity, gender, national origin or race. But none of those social markers may be used to discriminate against individuals in violation of our Constitution. Unlike the UK, in America we have no legally privileged class like a monarchy. Hence there is no privileged group here in law, though in social and cultural preference practices we may see evidence to the contrary. An HBCU for many black students is the same preference freedom of selection basis as the personals dating selections where, so to speak, ""birds of a feather flock together."" (SWF seeking SWM, etc.) Anti-discrimination laws have no force in dating. Why should the same laws deny Skylar from choosing a college or university based on the same extrinsic factors? We would no longer be a free country the day our government selects our mates to force social integration (or social disintegration of previously race-based or gender based institutions).', 'Thank you Beautifully written.

I taught in a HBCU and the students were given too many breaks in their education with many earning grades they had not worked for at all. Not all the black professors complied with this practice, but they were in a minority. One of the professors who taught writing there could not even write at middle school level. This professor was educated in HBCUs. I also experienced a lot of racism against whites and Hispanics, even against Jews, and extreme sexism I had never witnessed in institutions informed by Western culture.', ""I don't know where you taught but it appears that you brought your Eurocentric biases and concerns with you. There was a lot you could have learned from this setting, but you chose to view the experience in a stereotypical way. Too bad. You probably left the HBCU in the same limited way that you entered - feeling superior. I went to a HBCU for undergrad and then on to a highly ranked law school. Like the author of this piece, I was admitted to a number of other schools but chose the HBCU. So glad that I did because I received a world class education at a school with exceptional teachers who were demanding and truly cared about my future.

As You would say,  ""if You\'re feeling positive,  show me,  do something, or just feel it  -- but don\'t say it, ""  believing that speaking something generally dissipated it. (And,  in the spirit of Martin Buber,  we tried to keep our discourse in the first and second person pronouns as much as we could, to establish an I-You equivalence.)

If there is a large outdoor space for kids to potentially play, it should be stipulated in the co-op rules whether this is permissible. Ideally, the kids should be supervised. Unfortunately, unless everything is spelled out in writing, some people will take advantage. Sad but true. There are some people who will let their kids scream, yell, run around and throw tantrums without consideration to others. In NYC, that\'s just the way it is. And to the commenters who say, ""kids need a place to play."" Yes, they do. Take them to the park - which I realize involves time that the parents either don\'t have or don\'t wan\'t to spare. But that\'s too bad. They\'re your children and they need to run around. That\'s what kids do. I lived on a ground floor apartment in NYC for two years and most people were considerate, however there were also some who used the common areas as personal play spaces for their kids.

Yes, under certain circumstances, not having appropriate rules, or not enforcing the rules you have might be considered negligence, but that standing alone isn't a terribly compelling case.

If the kids are making inappropriate amounts of noise that are bothersome to other tenants, then I can understanding a gentle admonishment to quiet down.

I realize it is different in NYC where space is a precious commodity but also think if parents must live in an elevator building, it is up to them to keep them safe and occupied.

We have many, many thousands of community and condo associations in the U.S. today, and they\'re often something of a legal mess in part because they conceptualize themselves as mini-municipalities with over-meddling, oddball covenants, conditions and restrictions administered by whoever happens ""democratically"" or otherwise to capture the governance system.  When you\'re talking about intimate human associations, we\'d probably be better off starting on another template like the ones used by successful teams, business units, or even religious organizations.  The political/legal model doesn\'t work real well, writ small.', ""Parent's and or Caregivers should be held responsible."", ""I am troubled by this analysis. While it nominally acknowledges the responsibility of parents and caregivers to find appropriate places for children to play, the bulk of the piece is devoted to the board's/shareholders' responsibilities. That is part of the long trajectory away from parental responsibility toward collective responsibility. Don't overlook the fact that the parents and the shareholders are one and the same. If some parents want the coop to set aside a place for children to play, then they should persuade other shareholders and the board to do that. There is no a priori duty for the coop or board to provide such a space -- it is a matter for the coop to determine democratically in accordance with the coop's articles of incorporation and by-laws. Conceivably such a space might be impractical or too costly.  Indeed, (from a moral standpoint) the onus was on the parents, when they bought the coop, to make sure there was a space for children to play."", ""I concur with Sam. I believe Mr. Maitland, you are missing the point.  In the future you may age, and low and behold, that child you denied a sensible play location is now a physician, nurse, teacher of your grandchildren or second or third family's children, with a lack of community responsibility for future generations. Get a grip Mr. Maitland, please. America survives because we all survive and thrive. Yes, parents have responsibilities, but so does society if you want to have a future society. Is it too much to ask you Mr. Maitland to extend kindness of the heart to a child playing in a common area. It is not important if that child is fatherless or motherless for that matter secondary to death or disability. Needlless to say, the law cannot nor is it intended to right every wrong but the law exists to insure a level playing field so that we can all exist as individuals within the American society."", 'This assumes that people either (i) have children before they buy a coop or (ii) that thereafter they will not have children. Not even the most rigid coop board I know forbids people from having children. People have this annoying way of meeting, moving in together, and then having kids. Then they have to rearrange their lives around these kids and, in New York, abandoning a hard-won coop is often not economically practical.', ""Now everyone is responsible for everyone else's children?

Well greatest choke in sports history until the Atlanta Falcons met the Patriots in the Super Bowl and figured out how to blow a 25 point lead with 17 minutes left in the game.

It seemed that when it counted most, the Yankees came out on top. Then came 2004.  In the year after the Yanks won the AL championship series in the 11th inning of Game 7, the Red Sox came back from a 3-0 game deficit to win four straight and go on to win the World Series for the first time since 1918.

The real difference is in its current intensity which I attrribute to free agency. Everything changed after 1975.  Th eplayers for each team genuinely hated each other.  Are you old enough to remember Fisk and Munson going at it full tilt one game?  That wasn't just about violating some unwritten rule of the game.  That was about hatred.  Now to be honest, I do not venerate hatred and I despise violence, but I was a lot younger then and it was easier to think that stuff was important.  In an odd almost embarrassing way, it was fun.

As much as I love the Yankees, I'm in love with the game.  Not only do I remember the Munson-Fisk incident, I remember more fondly when during an exhibition against the White Sox, Deion Sanders (in his rookie season with the Yanks) hit a high pop that could've gone fair or foul, but everyone watching pretty much took it for granted that Fisk would make the catch.   When Sanders pretty much stood there - and after the catch was made - Fisk ripped into Sanders about not running out the ball.  He hounded the kid all the way back to the dugout and when Sanders was looking for some kind of comfort from his teammates, he received none. And, should the Yanks and Sox find themselves fighting for a division championship or LCS, only then will I consider it a rivalry once again."", ""The Red Sox - Yankees have such a colorful history going back over 100 years that it is hard to ignore even when neither team is good.

]",The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is the newest group to recommend that doctors wait to clamp and cut the cord of newborns.,"['At Michael Reese Hospital Medical Center in 1962 the OB waited to cut the umbilical cord to provide the baby with as much cord blood as possible. Again the date 1962.', 'Great to see this coverage, as iron is so important for the infant  brain.   Would love to see graphic artists find another symbol for infancy (e.g. Footprints, rubber ducks, rocking chair...)as breastmilk is  also important for infants. NYT please find another graphic.', 'I graduated medical school class of 58. At that time the practice was to \'milk"" the umbillical cord to deliver more blood to the newborn. Later the prevailing opinion turned to consider the overload of iron to the newborn as potentially harmful. It seems that opinion and practice swing back and forth, based on solid reasoning and meager research data,', 'My niece and nephew were born in the early 1990s. Both were delivered by a midwife who delayed in cutting the cord for several minutes to allow the blood to return to the baby. Also, if there is a breathing problem, the baby is still receiving oxygenated blood if the cord is not cut. Why is it taking this long for the medical profession to even investigate this issue? Birth is a natural process which doctors have turned into a disease. They want to take control even if it goes against common sense.', ""I learned this practice in nursing school in the 70s, especially for premies. I doubt anyone should worry that their term baby's cord was cut immediately. As a student nurse I was usually handed the placenta to examine for completeness, and I learned that after pregnancy and delivery that is one worn-out organ."", ""There's a few smug comments here chiding doctors and praising midwives, as though they belong to different species. Everyone in the delivery room is working from a perspective of best outcome for mother and child, based on intensive training and the latest science and technology. The previous preference for clamping, while possibly misplaced, was to prevent life-threatening haemorrhaging in the mother. Sure, as someone said, we gave birth in caves for millenia, but maternal and infant deaths are today (in the developed world) the lowest in human history. We left the caves for a reason, people - everything evolves, even science."", 'Midwife deliveries are great until they are not. When they are not (which can happen quickly), you want (need) a doctor ( now). IMHO, If you go that route please have a team that includes a doctor in a birthing center that offers everything you need. You  are being selfish (to your child\'s potential detriment)  if you don\'t (IMHO). I don\'t need to read any comments since the guaranteed great midwife, bad doctor, awesome personal experience are all below. True? Be careful, I\'ve heard what gets transferred to the ER from ""birthing centers""...', 'There used to be a program on TV called Maternity Ward. It was filmed in a hospital associated with Yale School of Medicine. Some babies were delivered by doctors and some by midwives in rooms right next to each other. It was amazing at the differences between the care the women received during delivery. One would never imagine the staff could be trained in the same institution and practice in the same hospital. No, I am not writing about cases where there was some medical emergency, but ordinary deliveries.', 'The major reason for the decrease in maternal infant deaths was the introduction of antibiotics in medicine.', 'To quote HB Atlee, our beloved  outspoken prof of OB at Dalhousie Medical School, from his c1957 text Gist of Obstetrics: ""CUTTING THE CORD:  Until now the baby has been left attached to the mother by the umbilical cord.  It is the practice of many doctors to cut the cord immediately the baby is born.  This is not a good thing to do, for the following reason:  If you leave the baby attached it gets from the placenta, as long as the cord continues to pulsate throughout its entire length, the equivalent of one or two blood transfusions (50-200cc.).  This blood is surely better in the baby than in the slop-pail.  But God has placed so thick a fog in some medical minds that they cannot see this: perhaps God has done this to you; too bad!  When the cord blanches, and stops pulsating except near the baby, you can cut if off after tying it about an inch from the baby.  Tie it with tape, not string.  String will cut through a friable cord like a knife.  Only in Rh negative babies whose mothers have been sensitized do you cut the cord immediately:  in those cases always tie the cord about 8 inches from the baby so that transfusions can be given into the umbilical vein."" What goes around comes around.', 'So delayed cord clamping is okay now that the very same professional organizations who advocated the opposite -- not for years but for many decades -- say so?  Be afraid, be very afraid, of traditional obstetrics practice.  Look to midwifery to lead the way, as it has, decades ahead of the professional obstetrics organizations.  Not just on cord clamping but on every last aspect of obstetrics that deviates from human evolutionary practice.', '“Be afraid, be very afraid?   “Look to Midwifery!” Sure I have a fetus with shoulder dystocia (Shoulder presentation vs head or foot or butt presentation) which is an UNDELIVERABLE position.  That fetal heart rate goes down to 60 I WANT A DOC THERE TO DO A QUICK C-SECTION. Why on earth is it necessary to “take sides?”  There certainly is enough work to go around.  Here in the USA our infant mortality rate is abysmal.  In Texas where they defunded Planned Parenthood--therefore pregnant moms aren’t getting pre-natal care, the mortality rate (death of baby and/or death of mother) has DOUBLED. Instead let’s all work together FOR THE BEST CARE OF THE PATIENTs! Having  been an Army nurse in Vietnam, then an ICU RN, then NP then off to medical school I have seen all sides of the issue--oh yeah and being a mom. So let’s stop the in-fighting!  OK?   Instead we should be writing our members of congress to NOT repeal the Affordable care Act.  You want to get on a soapbox?  Let’s keep insurance for ALL Americans and not just the Trump families and the top 10% of earners. We need universal coverage, nationalized child care, universal pre-K, and maternity and paternity leave as every other modern country has except for us. Susan you may be fortunate enough to be able to choose a midwife.There are WAY too many women who are NOT getting pre-natal care at all.  And for those who dislike immigrants,I’d rather be doing pre-natal care for an immigrant than having $10 million NICU infant.', 'I’m a midwife and an advocate for home birth, evidence-based practice and women’s absolute right to make informed decisions regarding their health and birth choices, and I am concerned by your comment. While I acknowledge the horrendous practices in the history of obstetrics, I have worked with amazing obstetricians who are incredibly skilled and supportive of midwives and women, and I believe anti-obstetrics language ultimately harms our cause and the women we serve.  This is a great recommendation (if a bit delayed) by ACOG and should be recognized as a positive thing—obstetricians may have been trained differently than midwives, but their ultimate goal is helping women and babies. I’m proud of how midwifery has led the way, but I also value the life-saving advances of modern medicine. When you criticize “every last aspect of obstetrics that deviates from human evolutionary practice,” are you suggesting we not intervene to save women and babies? We thankfully don’t see it much in high-income countries, but too many women and newborns around the world still die because they lack the care we take for granted. This does not excuse the real problem of obstetric over-intervention or invalidate the beauty of natural birth, but if we don’t recognize the real risks of childbirth and respect the skills of obstetricians, we are doing a disservice to women.', 'Necrotizing enterocolitis would be more accurately described as ""life threatening"" than ""serious.""', 'The brain takes on iron until around the age of 26.  That is why some believe that young teens, etc., are impulsive, as the brain is not fully developed.', ""According to a presentation by Dr. Nicholas Fogelson (see You Tube), a baby only has 60% of its blood supply at birth.  By waiting 3 minutes, it has almost 100%.  Early cord clamping/cutting coincided with women who were heavily medicated during labor and gave birth to medically depressed babies who needed stimulation and sometimes resuscitation.  With so many women opting for natural birth or epidurals, this is no longer an issue.  When my grand daughter was born, she got some meconium in her respiratory tract.  They did not cut the cord until 5 minutes after birth, and then began clearing her airway.  She pinked up quickly, and stayed pink during the procedures.  25 minutes later, still grunting a little, she was laid on her mother's abdomen, and within 10 minutes began breastfeeding.  There was no more grunting or any indication of any respiratory problem after that point.  One of the nursery nurses was advocating taking her to the NICU for obsevation, but thankfully the other nurse was recently certified as a midwife and  understood the benefits of delayed cord clamping and skin to skin contact with the mother.   As the doula, and RN childbirth educator and lactation consultant, I was pleased with how the baby was cared for."", 'so docs needed evidence before they would allow delay in cutting, but they didn\'t need any evidence to assert that immediate cutting must be good for the mom? surrounding birth in particular compared with other medical disciplines, there is a lack of evidence-based medical thinking. and probably not enough ""if it ain\'t broke don\'t \'fix\' it"" common sense.', 'I\'m a layman in this regard but it makes sense to me.  Humans, in our current form, have been giving birth for well on two hundred thousand years.  In caves, on the ground in fields, trees and beds.  Everywhere.  Immediate cord clamping and the like have only been practiced for....what....less than 100 years?  I think it wise, wherever possible, to defer to the practices proscribed by \'ol Mother Nature.  There\'s probably a good reason why ""she"" does a slow shut-down on the child\'s primary coupling, the umbilical, to the mother.  It\'s been the main conduit, the source of all health and nutrition from the mother, until birth.  This article infers there might be a VERY good reason.  We should conduct ourselves, with our infants, more wisely than we have these past few decades. Just some thoughts. John~ American Net\'Zen', ""And once again midwifery protocol leads the way.  Even the notion that one must cut the cord in a case of respiratory depression begs the question of why one must take away the source of oxygen right when the newborn is in the most need. Baby needs oxygen? Well there's 2-4 minutes worth of richly oxygenated blood right there in the placenta. Plenty of work can be done by the mothers side. She's warm and her voice is there. Warming tables are a convenience, not a necessity"", ""I've always thought about this:  My son was born full term, with mom taking all of the prenatal vitamins and doing every other healthy thing recommended during her pregnancy... no complications pre-birth... the pregnancy went very well.  When he was born though, he had aspirated some meconium, so he wasn't breathing.  The doc cut his cord right away and another doc quickly took him to another room to suction him.  She came back (in what seemed like forever) but probably in reality, five or ten minutes later, with my son crying like a newborn.   For the first two years he was a difficult baby, to say the least.  At two years he was diagnosed with autism.  He's now ten (still autistic).  I was always wondering about the doctor's decision to cut the cord before he was breathing on his own... If a baby is still able to get oxygen from the placenta when the cord has not yet been cut, why cut it if the baby can't breath on his own yet?  Why not set up the suction machine right next to the bed, where the baby could still be attached to the cord?  Could my son's brain have been deprived of oxygen in that five or ten minutes that he was out of the room getting suctioned? Could his autism have been avoided if he was still attached to mom and a source of oxygen?"", 'We saved the cord blood from our twins and still have it frozen after more than a decade, for possible use in the future for serious illness or injury. Very, very unlikely to need it, but feels better to have a stash.  On the other hand, there are compelling arguments against the idea -  http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-baby/cord-blood-banking/the-cord-blo...', 'I had asked about delayed cord clamping with my son, but my doctor said since we were banking the cord blood, delayed clamping would not be possible. Does anyone have further information on that?', 'When I was training as a midwife, decades ago, we were told to allow the cord to stop beating before cutting it. This was not only to allow blood to continue to flow into the baby from the still attached placenta, but also, and probably more importantly, to insure adequate oxygen levels, especially if there was any delay in the infant breathing. The cord stops functioning on its own when the baby no longer needs it for life support. Considering the benefit to blood and oxygen, I find it astonishing, in a bad way,  that anyone would cut the cord so quickly. What is the big rush?']","Almost every commentator agrees that cutting the cord immediately after birth is a harmful practice. Several commentators note that it allows the baby to receive more blood and gives better outcomes. One commentator preserved the blood from the cord in case of a life-threatening emergency.

It's a sign they're thinking and listening. Some updates of operas work well (Carmen updates have a long and interesting history). But Gelb has a talent for picking directors-as-authors who lack any talent for opera, especially the talent for listening to the music. Audiences, both young and old, don't attend grand opera to see what they can behold on a Broadway stage. They go to see the wonder of what a large elaborate staging can do. Opera was the inspiration for cinema. Modern stagings often reduce opera to cheap small-screen productions. No wonder the Met is going broke. When will the Board wake up?"", 'Ochs was a caricature of Trump. I loved the performance.', ""Thoroughly enjoyed the dress rehearsal.  However, at the opera's conclusion the young lovers should have traditionally been presented with the silver rose - more poignant than Mohammed staggering, swinging a bottle of wine. And yes, a bit too much frolicking for me. Could have been shortened."", ""It's frustrating when the direction goes against the music and/or the text. But English-speaking audiences tend to over-romanticize the piece because, even with surtitles, the cynicism that runs through Hofmannsthal's text (the shallowness of Octavian, the air-headedness of Sophie, who is every inch her bourgeois father's daughter) usually fails to come through all the spun sugar. So don't weep too hard for Der Rosenkavalier, It's a nastier bit of business than you may think."", ""Re: booing the production team, it's not for updating the action, but for stage business working in opposition to the music.  Particularly tone-deaf was the pointless waltzing in the background during the Presentation of the Rose.  Strauss' music perfectly capturing the time-stands-still quality of love at first sight is undermined by all the stage movement, which I found distracting and idiotic.  Special hubris award goes to a director who ignores the lighthearted spirit of the woodwind music concluding the opera, originally to depict the servant boy  searching for the Marschallin's handkerchief.  Pulling the set walls back to reveal cannons and armies has absolutely nothing to do with what is happening in the music.  I wish opera directors would LISTEN to the music before they willfully override the stage directions of theatrical geniuses like Strauss and Hofmannsthal."", ""I enjoyed the production very much.  The liberties taken from the original libretto were minor and who's to say Strauss would not have appreciated a production that adds depth and stinging social commentary to his lighthearted comedy.  Opera composers have always appreciated that the aristocracy prefers social commentary to be lighthearted and farcical rather than pointed and direct, and have tailored their works accordingly, but the substance is there for a producer who wants to bring it out."", ""I think the new production is a vast improvement over the 1969 one, which was well overdue for retirement. Particularly impressive was the obvious care Mt. Carsen gave to shape the interactions between the Marschallin and Octavian -- personenregie of the highest and most sensitive quality. Garanca acted the role with greater believability than I've ever seen, and Fleming was better than I've seen and heard her in many years. Carsen's track record at the Met is stronger than any other director I know -- the superb Onegin and Mefistofele, and now Falstaff and Rosenkavalier under Gelb. Hopefully they'll bring him back for a non-comedic piece soon, as I think that's where his work is strongest. I attend opera performances every few months in Europe, and while I am not a fan of much of the intrusive directorial interventions that are commonplace in European opera houses, European performances are much more successful at attracting audiences diverse in age and background. It will take more productions like this Der Rosenkavalier, which respects the libretto, but takes care to engage the mind and heart of the viewer, if the Met and other American opera companies are to cultivate the next generation of opera lovers."", 'I attended a recital by Ms. Fleming last year in Stevens Point Wi. She patronized us, asking with great skepticism if we had Live at the Met ""up here?"" (Yes we do, in Wausau.) Then, astonishingly, she asked for a show of hands if ""any of you had ever been to a recital before?"" She then proceeded to crack up on her first high note of the evening and did not revisit that part of her range for the rest of the evening, instead coyly trying to ""sell"" us alternate low-note endings. Not impressed at her on a personal or performing level.', ""Two friends & I were at the opening & this review's praise is well deserved. It was beautiful musically, vocally & the sets & costumed worked well with the story & music, though the third act location was a little over the top, if you see it you'll see what I mean. All in all a wonderful evening of Opera"", 'La Traviata.  Tosca.  Das Rheingold.  Die Walkure.  Siegfried.  Gotterdammerung.  Add to these abysmal directorial disasters another beloved, traditional opera that the Met has destroyed. Just watch the last 10 minutes and try not to cringe.', ""I am sorry but Fleming's singing yesterday left a lot to be desired. It was bizarre at best. She was no match for the legendary Cheryl Studer back in '00 also at the Met. Here she is. Read the description in the video for more details: https://youtu.be/3JA9DpCuz1w"", ""I cannot wait until next Friday to see this from my customary seat.  This is a perfect role for Renee Fleming, even though the Marschallin is at MOST 30, having been married off to an older man when very young.  Might that have happened too in early 20th century?  Who knows.  We always have to suspend disbelief at opera.  Generous of Elina Garanca, who would be a stunning princess if the part were transposed for mezzo, to play a trouser role.  If it is Fleming's farewell to fully staged opera at our house, hail and farewell, we have always loved you."", 'The libretto says the Marschallin is 50.', 'The libretto clearly states that the Marschallin is in her thirties.', 'I think that those that booed last night (and who boo most new productions of work in the ""cannon"") might be those who have a preconceived and maybe ossified view of the work and how it SHOULD look. Probably because the new production forces them to confront that view which in the case of their ""ideal"" Rosenkavilier is all whipped cream and gold. But I think the production team carefully considered the von Hoffmansthal libretto and amplified the social and psychological aspects of the work to great effect. It was hardly over the top and was gorgeous to look at with the design amplifying the music an libretto.', 'I could not agree more. Well said! The updated setting gave it more psychological depth. Made you focus more on the social commentary that Strauss and von Hoffmansthal peppered throughout the work.', ""If the production team carefully considered the von Hoffmansthal libretto, that's even more depressing."", 'I disagree that the bass lacked depth, he nearly stole the show and had an incredible voice. The first act he was less impressive but as the night went on he really impressed', ""What ravishing singing from everyone-- the  sexy Ochs brought a new malevolence to the character -- making him a kind of Don Giovanni . Yes there were some mis steps in the production but I liked the heightening  of the undercurrents of the libretto- desire and death juxtaposing  military and social interactions. Look the last one was wonderful but it was 50 years old;  if nothing else it needed much repair. Thank god this new one  was not like the Traviata travesty -- or the Fidelio I went to in Munich  with Don Fernando as the joker and the singers strapped into a jungle gym, talk about booing the germans almost brought the house down . I will return to this run at least once more  since not only is Fleming leaving her role but supposedly it is Garanca's last Octavian too ."", 'This production will be in the theaters as the MET HD. in May. Probably then on TV  from PBS. If you have a DVR, you can record it and if you have the equipment, transfer to a DVD. Maybe there will be a commercial DVD..', ""One can be confident that the rare chorus of boos at the conclusion of a new production at the Metropolitan Opera are always for a director's off-key dramatic conception or a scenic designer's edging too far from an exciting and dramatic visual accompaniment to the composer's score to one of disregard, sometimes even bordering on disrespect, and never for the brilliant, dedicated voices on stage.  Renee Fleming and her brilliant colleagues were well aware all the bravos were for them, and most deservedly so; the boos were for the production team."", 'Rene Fleming\'s performance last night was one of peerless, heart-breaking delicacy.  And as everyone in the audience knew that this is her swan song, it was almost unbearably poignant.  Unfortunately, in heavy contrast, the production team\'s choice to conflate the Marschallin\'s passing beauty and erotic power with the historical passing of the old regime by updating the production to the days before World War I, felt painfully banal and coarse.  Instead of making the message of the opera ""bigger"", it minimized the personal tragedy and final wisdom of the Marschallin.  The unintended sadness of the evening came as a consequence of seeing the pathos of Rene Fleming\'s final operatic performance so badly served by an overreaching production team.  But, my God, was she wonderful, despite all that.', 'The boos were NOT for Fleming, but for the production -- at the Met, it is highly traditional to boo new productions.', ""Except when they're not the misguided result of directorial arrogance.  I have been to many premieres that were justifiably cheered."", 'It was lovely last night, all of it. The ongoing ""booing"" from a small group of the audience was saddening.  It is a reminder that America is losing its decency.  It was especially disconcerting that it happened inside the Metropolitan Opera House, which is a monument to the Arts, and the centerpiece of Lincoln Center.  Last night was a very special night for Rene Fleming. Hopefully, our Grande Soprano heard more BRAVOS than anything else.  Respect in the Age of Trump is becoming a rarity.', ""Opera audiences can be as passionate and expressive as baseball audiences. I personally don't boo what I don't like at either opera or baseball--but booing is not a recent phenomenon. Audiences used to be more demonstrative a generation ago--with cheers, boos, and flowers. My theory is that union overtime costs have made American opera companies push through any mid-scene applause that could force a production to run a few minutes over."", 'Nobody booed Ms. Fleming, or any of the other singers for that matter.', 'Maybe grand opera is losing its decency.

There is a big difference between setting out to annihilate every Jew in Europe -- men, women, and children who had done no harm -- and dropping a bomb on a Japanese island in the course of a war.  For that matter, ask the Chinese how innocent the Japanese were, and what massacres feel like. In the course of all human history, and let's count the 1.5-million Armenians, there has never been a systematic extermination of a people totaling over 6 million. If you'd like, you can count the extra 5-million gay people, Communists, anti-Nazi activists, and mentally deficient in that count.  I suppose you are counting the Palestinians who get caught when their brave terrorist warriors take shelter, and shelter their weapons, in schools and hospitals after launching missile attacks into Israel and then cry foul when the Israelis retaliate. Pretty ridiculous."", ""Hate to nitpick, N. Smith, but Africans were, with the help of other Africans, usually rival tribes, imported into the American colonies in order to work, and were bred like animals to perform certain types of work.  Many died, and many were killed because of disobedience. Families were separated, and children were sold off. Pretty awful, but the fate of slaves throughout history. That still doesn't amount to a deliberate extermination of a race of people.  Frankly, slaves were too valuable to waste.  So no, Jews aren't the only ones to have suffered. But I challenge you to come up with any other episode in history that rises to the level of what happened to the Jews."", ""Since WW II, the word Holocaust with a capital H has stood for the annihilation of 6 million Jews through the machinations of the Nazi war machine, solely because Hitler wanted to rid the planet of their so-called race.  This in no way belittles or ignores the sufferings of any other group--or indeed of any individual.  Throughout history every ethnic or minority group has suffered at the hands of a stronger group.  Indeed, one of the many important reasons for remembering the Holocaust is to try to make sure that such a thing never happens again to anyone.  To date, we've been pretty feeble in our efforts. So stop venting your spleen on Holocaust Remembrance, and start looking for ways to keep your neighbor safe."", '12 years? I am not questioning the importance of this story.

Even worse, there are anti-Israel activists who even try to claim that what the Palestinians are living is like the concentration camps when such claims have been found to baseless on that.  Seriously, were the Jews doing terrorist attacks before the Nazis made them live in those camps let alone launch rockets and other projectiles from them?

Of course their lives mattered. There are monuments, cemeteries and memorials to the WW2 dead all over the world. But those who raise the question are denying the facts of the Final Solution. The only time in history that a government planned and orchestrated the anihilation of an entire group of people. And frankly they were quite successful wiping out an entire culture in Europe and shortly following in the Middle Eastern countries. Nations where Jews lived for thousands of years.

The Holocaust gets central billing because it was unique in human history: an institutionalized, centralized, mechanized unrelenting industry of annihilation targeting not a nation, but an entire race of people.  The goal was to eliminate the present, erase the past and prevent a future for anything Jewish. The Romans, the Conquistadores and the European/American slave traders did their worst but could not do (and perhaps did not want to do for economic purposes) what the Nazis did and would have done given enough time or a few more twists of battlefied fate."", 'So as not to put light verse among the comments to today\'s important and too-relevant lead story, in a nod to the ""In the News"" knish-related item today ""An Ode to Mrs. Stahl\'s,"" I hope it\'s OK to just link to what IIRC was the first time I had the nerve to put a lyric in the City Room section, which happened to be my own Mrs. Stahl\'s Knish tribute back in Oct 2014.

The Times held that story for another year before printing it, when their revelations COULD have affected the outcome of the 2004 Bush-Kerry election.

I was in Diyarbakir (which is also a fascinating old place) and I really doubt that your overland suggestion of entering Iraq from Turkey is feasible, given the tension between the current Turkish regime and the Kurds. Do you know of any tourists who have done that? There are checkpoints aplenty in that part of Turkey and even in quieter times (like in 2004 when I was there and all local Kurds of fighting age had gone to Iraq) it was not an easy place to travel.', ""Fascinating article.  Just one complaint - there's no information about how it is for women to travel here.  This should be included in most, if not all, international travel articles."", 'Tim,  You did an amazing job of bringing to life  a foreign and mysterious place to many Americans.  The descriptive detail is great, and I was able to imagine what it is like there even without the pictures.  Your sensitive handling of a land filled with so much turmoil is exceptional.  One detail I\'ll always remember wsa when you were invited to step through the door but not to step on the threshold because "" Angels sleeps in doorways"".  Thanks for sharing your adventurous life with those of us who may never see these places ourselves!  P.S.  You were always a good writer, and now you inspire others with that talent!', 'I wonder what the immigration officer will say when you get back to the US...', 'I loved this article and would love to go.  Probably not going to happen but if it did, it would be a trip of a lifetime.   Thanks for this great article.  Keep them coming.', 'Heartbreaking, hopeful and fascinating writing. Another powerful piece form the talented Tim Neville. Standing in what’s left of Saddam’s blown out palace, watching Kurds pack a cooler for a day on the water... thank you for making the choice to tell this story and in your honest, colorful and tender way. My mom retired this year—I will share this with her and maybe this will be the most unexpected retirement trip possible!', 'We have the largest Kurdish community in the US in Nashville and they are fantastic people.

I've made multiple trips to Iraqi Kurdistan since 2009 and have been overwhelmed by the generosity and warmth of people I have met and spent time with there. I normally just fly into Sulaimani or Erbil via Istanbul, and am hopeful these airports will be re-opened soon.  One note about the travel insurance mentioned at the end of the story: my experience is that insurance companies classify Iraqi Kurdistan just like other parts of Iraq (i.e., a war zone), and don't take into account the very different (better) safety conditions there. This makes the insurance very expensive, and so for those on a tight budget, it's often not feasible. Since the biggest risk, as in many other places, is probably traffic accidents, the most sensible thing to me always seemed to be to be judicious about how you travel, and to try not to ride with taxi drivers who insist on going 120 mph on one-lane highways!"", 'For those of us who will never visit, your photographs are beautiful.

His claim to fame are two. 1. Victor. He routed Crusaders wanting to open Europe-Asia trade. Christians were being starved by Sunni Kaliphate Tariffs (Arabic word). 2. Father of Madressahs. Believing that research on matter was ungodly, he closed down world's first secular university (Al-Azhar), banned natural sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Medicine), Math, logic, philosophy, art, rhetoric.

Their lives rich, yet languished by century old conflicts, impetuous Western interference, still breathes incredible human spirit.  It is the will to laugh, to kayak, to dance, to worship, to thrive and flourish.     As I head into my day, in this safe haven of comforts, I wonder about Middle East as I pass by people in this multicultural North American city.   How can their families back home flourish and feel safe?  Perhaps Amartya Sen's book, Development as Freedom, is a beginning; then I realize, the most real and proximal I can do is to stop and listen.  Listen to my Middle Eastern colleagues about their lives, invite them for a meal, create a community of understanding.  That is the most real thing I can do before tonights's speech."", 'The 40 million ethnic Kurds are Sunni Muslims with their own language and culture without a nation state where they are a majority.  Kurds are maligned and marginalized by their fellow Sunni Muslim ethnic Arabs and Turks. Kurds are also mistreated by Shia Muslim ethnic Arabs and ethnic Persians.

Iraq is a fiction:  a  hodge podge of mutually hostile peoples cobbled together for administrative convenience by British imperialism. Of all its disparate parts, the Kurds are outstanding and have always been the most effective, and most steadfast of America\'s allies.  An ancient, much oppressed people, they are well educated, disciplined and courageous. Their weakness historically has been schism in the face of external enemies, with one faction selling out the other and thereby letting in the enemy.  Now, however, the vibrant Kurdistan which has emerged in northern Iraq demonstrates that this resilient people have definitely got their act together. Our policy in that part of the world should have been, from the beginning, focused on supporting the Kurds -- and this is what it should be now. Including in Syria against the Turks.']","Commentators praise the article. One commentator reports that he and his wife had an excellent travel experience when they went to Kurdistan.

Walking in the woods is its own reward.  Sure, you should pay attention to the sights, sounds and smells, but the kind of mindfulness described here takes you well into yourself not out of yourself.  You can do that anywhere.   Now, are we talking walking or hiking?  I see them as different.  Hiking is more purposeful in amount of energy expended, which is related to distance traveled.  I have found from many hundreds of miles of hiking that I get into a different zone, much like meditation, after about three hours of steady hiking.  That is a lot for some people, and more than anyone needs for fitness purposes, but it's a different experience and requires no formula or book for deriving significant mental refreshment and improved perspective.

My best hikes are alone and in more remote areas of the country, especially on trails where I gain altitude and get to look back over the scenery below as I ascend. I experience PEACE as I become one with the universe on these journeys.  The wildlife I see on these trips is exciting and I’m grateful to see nature up close.

On the surface, yes, it's very nice these people are inviting immigrants - both illegal and legal into their home. But I'm just so tired of seeing articles like this. Is it possible to curb illegal immigration compassionately? Wouldn't that be best for Americans? Of course when you meet people on an individual level and invite them into your home, it is far different than dealing with immigration on a large scale.

Many times these patients had better health insurance than myself. In other words, I could not have received the same quality of healthcare. Certainly, people here illegally have it difficult. I know that first hand from working in the poorest sections of the Bronx where many are just hanging by a thread. But I also know from my work in healthcare that people come here just to have children and for the benefits provided.  And I have to ask myself, what about the American I treated today in the hospital who was homeless with no safety net who will wind up back on the street? Like I said above, it's nice to invite people into your home but until you see illegal immigration first hand and how a subsection of Americans are either pushed aside and/or have lost jobs because of it, it's easy to think America can take care of everyone.

Democrats have tried to pass and would still like to pass immigration reform that  would tide the flow of illegal immigrants while providing a path to legality for those that have already made a life here (the compassionate part). I do also think ""the left"" in general believes that it\'s our moral duty (and honor) to take in asylum seekers and refugees. I think that\'s the compassionate thing to do as well, but there are rules about asylum seekers and vetting for refugees; no one (in the mainstream) is arguing for those rules to go away, just that they are humane, with due process and fair treatment. Exactly what you seem to wish for.', ""It's wonderful that one of the widest reactions to Trump's political overreach is the energizing of civil society on the left.

It's extremely easy to decry the president and to shout about the ills in the world, but to gather anywhere from four to four-hundred people and discuss what should be done? It is from that, that we find practical steps to take. We need to be reminded that, as a democracy, the weight of bad governance falls upon us.

If we went to a resort for a week, I think 3 or 4 half or full days plus a couple evenings of alone/us time sound about right (of course that's assuming we know she's enjoying her caregivers/activities).

Don't get me wrong, I sorely miss alone daytime time with my husband, but sacrificing precious time with my kids is not the answer. Not while they are awake anyway. Family vacation is a time for the family to bond and spend quality time together.  Now, after the kids go to bed, that's a different story. That's when we get our alone time, and that's where babysitting help is the most needed. We will travel with another family with kids this summer, and will take turns watching the kids and going out.

For example, if the score is tied 1-1, and the player makes a great catch that saves a run, the score remains tied at 1-1.  If he does not make the catch, the opposing team leads 2-1.  That run-scoring missed ball can only be made up for by player himself or a teammate getting a run-scoring hit, thus tying the game at 2-2.  In other words, a player who prevents a run from scoring by making a great play, makes the equivalent of hitting for a run.  Tired to make that clear, but not sure if I succeeded!!

For example, the Concord Landfill -- bemoaned for its proximity to Walden Pond -- has been capped for many years, since well before this article was written. The Landfill is now used for public yard waste composting, a used paint exchange (so the paint can be reused), and a large photovoltaic array. Concord, MA made the news in 2013 for being one of the first communities to ban sale of small bottles of bottled water. In addition to splashing around in the shallows, many swimmers regularly swim the entire distance across Walden Pond, or its 1.7 mile circumference. What is more an act of solitude than swimming in open water? One swimming website even uses Thoreau's 1846 map!

We didn\'t have any of that, only grief and an infant-sized coffin. But because it\'s not something our society often talks about, I found many people did not understand the depth of grief that accompanies such an experience.

Parents sing to it, kiss it, and share their hopes and dreams for this child for 9 months.  Early ultrasounds reinforce the reality and the sex of the child, beginning the process of figuring out a name.  Both parents listen to the heartbeat and experience kicking movements together. Rooms are painted and cribs are purchased based on these hopes and dreams for the future. Then, wham, that love, the excitement, and future die suddenly with the death of the baby.  Parents grief for their child that grew inside literally and symbolically, and the future memories they will not experience.

As for 'these people bringing their conflicts to England (sic)' - the man who committed this crime was not an immigrant, or a foreigner, any more than the people who blew up the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1985, in an attempt to kill Margaret Thatcher.

]","Wednesday: Sinatra’s “New York, New York,” a bull escape in Queens, and representatives around town.","[""I'm disappointed no mention of who the baseball player was sitting next to Sinatra.It's Phil Rizzuto,a Brooklyn boy and a real New Yorker."", 'CORRECTION: With due respect to Messrs. Kander and Ebb - not to mention that consummate performer, Ed Koch - a torch song (pun intended) that would do New York proud, is the \'other\' New York-themed song from ""On the Town."" It is ""Lonely Town"" by Leonard Bernstein, with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The song must have been close to Frank Sinatra\'s heart, as he was apparently particularly peeved by its erasure - along with most of Bernstein\'s music - from the 1949 film version of ""On the Town"" by Arthur Freed, the all-powerful head of the ""Freed Unit"" at MGM, which produced the bulk of the lavish MGM musicals from the late 1940s to the 1960s. Sinatra would eventually record ""Lonely Town"" for his 1957 album ""Where Are You?"", and he performed it, one might say ""with a vengeance,"" years later at a concert in Carnegie Hall. There he introduced the song by stomping his foot a couple of times on the floor of the stage and announcing to ""Arthur"" that he was going to sing ""Lonely Town,"" and this time ""Arthur"" wouldn\'t be able to stop him. It was clear even to those in the audience who weren\'t in the know, that whoever ""Arthur"" was, he was ""six feet under."" Indeed, Arthur Freed had died the previous year.', 'When I was growing up, ""The Bronx is up and the Battery\'s down!"" was THE New York song and I always enjoyed hearing it. Maybe it\'s just because I loved it first or maybe it\'s really better (well, how can one song be ""better"" anyway), but I like it about 1000 times more than I like ""New York, New York"" which by now I actively dislike. It was okay the first couple dozen times I heard it, but by now, just ugh. The bombast that Sinatra projects became very off-putting.', ""Senator Jeff Klein's constituents in NY Senate 34 are concerned with his alignment with the State Republicans. We would like him to have a town hall. After repeated calling he still hasn't decided."", ""Sinatra did make this his own, but boy, Minelli's version resonates!"", 'It will always be Liza\'s song, not Frank\'s.  It should be said that it is really Kander and Ebb\'s ""Theme from New York, New York.""  Sinatra changed the lyrics, much to Fred Ebb\'s chagrin.   John Kander said that he prefers Liza\'s version on NY1 recently.', 'NO BULL THIS Unlike Pamplona, with Devoted chasers full, Right here in old New York The bulls run after the bull.', 'I really don\'t know why you wouldn\'t make Billy Joel\'s version of ""New York State of Mind"", by Billy Joel....a choice.   Ms. Keys is definitely iconic, but so is he - and he wrote it.', 'In her cabaret act, Kaye Ballard said, ""Several years ago, Liza Minnelli had a song about New York written just for her.  Recently, Frank Sinatra had the same song written just for him."" Not only did Sinatra change the lyrics (""A Number One"" was never IN the song let, alone inexplicably repeated) but due to his diminished vocal capabilities by the time he got around to singing it, he modulated DOWN where Kander and Ebb modulated UP, which has always made his version unlistenable for me, despite being a big Sinatra fan. To her credit, when Minnelli appeared with Sinatra and they sang the song together, she sang it in his key.  Still, for many of us who first heard her introduce it in the film, her original version from the soundtrack is far superior to his (admittedly better-selling) recording.', ""Being a huge Sinatra fan, I was in New York last year, and rode the bus over to Hoboken to pay homage. My husband and I took the walking tour of Frank's boyhood haunts. We gazed at Manhattan from the shore. It was February, and in the winter light, I have never seen a more beautiful view of New York City."", ""I always thought it was odd and dare I say it, sexist, that the Yankees would play Sinatra's version when they won, and Minelli's version when they lost. Not sure if they still do that though."", 'Jay Z\'s ""song"" is nothing but a uncreative laundry list of things in NY. I think it\'s garbage. The classic songs about NY that will last forever are New York, New York by Frank Sinatra, and New York State of Mind by Billy Joel. Jay Z\'s song should go the way of the subway token.', 'A quintessential New York song*   Another Hundred People  Another hundred people just got off of the train And came up through the ground, While another hundred people just got off of the bus And are looking around At another hundred people who got off of the plane And are looking at us Who got off of the train And the plane and the bus Maybe yesterday.

}]","In this video, Times journalists at a BTS concert in Newark explore what draws so many black fans to Korean pop music.","['This film shows how many African Americans like Korean pop. A lot of African Americans a like to attend the concerts of the Korean pop band named BTS. Some African Americans wanted to change somethings about Korean pop. One African American woman said that Korean pop music doved her crazy when she heard Korean pop. At the beginning of the video the lady who is speaking says that Korean pop exploded in the years since Youtube was created. This means that this music genre has been popular for a very long time. In my opinion, BTS is a very great band with a lot of talent.', 'What stood out most to me was when multiple people talked about how similar k-pop was to hip pop, and to be honest I don’t listen to k-pop, but from what I have heard and/or seen they are not that similar. The whole video was a surprise to me. I had no idea that k-pop had such a huge black fan base. The best part was when someone had said that the reason she loves k-pop was that she could be herself and let her creativity flow and others say they love it because of how it brings people of all types of people. And the message that that idea sends is that just because something isn’t necessarily “popular” in your situation doesn’t mean you can’t pursue it, all that matters is that you are happy in the end.', 'I have a couple of friends who are black who have been long-time fans of many K-Pop groups and artists. At first, I found this odd because the two cultures seem dissimilar in many ways; but the music itself has unified these groups of people despite it. Throughout the history of popular music, language barriers have never been too great for people of different parts of the world to connect and enjoy. I think it much easier now for the music to spread with a greater access to technology. People are no longer limited to only hearing the music that plays on their local radio station or what is sold nearby. I think this interaction shows how much more dominant Western cultures can be in music. In the video, many of the black fans said they can find some similar styles and English phrases in the songs that they enjoy, which makes me wonder how much of the Korean culture do they actually truly learn more about or appreciate. Though I find the ""crossing of cultures"" good and important, I hope that the appeal towards K-Pop comes from more than its similarities to Western/American popular music but also its uniqueness and strong depiction of Asian/Korean culture.', 'The film surprized me in the fact that I can see a cycle in the globalization steak. It is not just a one way thing where the music is diffused to another area but on top of that the ather areas have put their influence on the music, altering it in a different way and then diffusing that music style as well. It is fascinated to see the streanght of communication that music has brought among our cultures. People from completly different cultures who are absolute opposites of one another in features, backgroungs and even belief systems are able to communicate well with each other in music.', 'Trying to watch this video was a major fail because of the spinning effect it had on it, so instead of getting to watch the video I had to listen to the audio. While listening to the teens in the video speak about K-pop it sounds like it has the same effect a regular band has on other teens. K-pop lets teens be themselves and allows them to make new friends that shares the same excitement as each other. One complaint I heard was the fact that K-pop uses a lot black genre but never credits it. They also have controversy in cultural races causing racial problems, but other than that K-pop seems to keep their fans happy!', 'Watching this, I was very intrigued that people with different cultures could come together to do things that they enjoy. As this one girl said when she was interviewed, ""I love the way it brings people together. People from every place around the world can come together for one group with a language they don\'t even speak, but somehow, music is universal and they all understand it."" K-Pop sounds similar to the type of music in America, which shows that there is cultural connections between the two.  Music can bring people together from around the world and it showed that any music can influence any person anywhere in the world.', 'I agree, the magic of connection in music is amazing. Music is something that can bring different people to get findings of something similar to one another. From all across waters, across borders, across neighborhoods, across religions Music will spread through any place. Music is not for one person it will cause Korean Artist to apeal to African Americans. From the United States to Asia, Africa, and western Europe. The main message of the film has all and everything to do with people and music. It is very special in that these are the things we do but do not highlight. Music is made to connect, spread, and change. But most of all music is a brige that leads to many routes.', 'I was also intrigued by how the fans were all able to understand the music despite it being in another language. The video shows how K-Pop unifies the different cultures, but also how the cultures have adopted some elements of the popular styles of music as their own. Part of me feels like this is the major reason why some many people can enjoy it: because it sounds similar to popular music in Western/American culture. I think that the lines are becoming more and more blurred in the differences between many genres of music. I think that the video showed how this has been unifying but also controversial.', 'In the film ""Crossing Cultures: Black K- pop Fan in America"", shows a K- pop group who sings and rap in Korean. This Korean group are formerly known as the BTS and their are one of the best K -Pop groups. The Korean group has sold out two shows in New York and New Jersey. Nicole Fineman , Samantha Quick, and Logan Jaffe film artists want to know why. So these film artist went to the show and interview people. To get a better understanding why so many people in America want to go see a Korean group. While interviewing the film artist found out majority who paid to see BTS perform were African Americans. I found it quite surprising that K- Pop is listened to by many African Americans as soon as i heard that I became very interested in this film. I always appreciate in people finding interest in other cultures. While the film artist were at the K -Po show they interview the audience on why they are fond of the BTS. Sometimes the BTS music can have controversy between people. However many people enjoy BTS crossing of music.', 'I was surprised to see the combination of Korean pop culture and Black culture. It was very intriguing to see how that combination would play out. The two cultures seemed pretty different to each other and they are uniting together to enjoy a similar genre of music. The reason why I found this combination so intriguing was mainly because of the difference in location to where these music genres are popular. K-Pop is very popular in Asia, which surprised me when i saw the trend spread to America, especially people associated with "" black culture "". But I also understand the trend because of the similarities between american pop music and K-pop. The language is different, but the style of the music is similar which is why k-pop has influenced so many different types of people.', ""This film was very interesting because kpop is widely seen as Asian music by a lot of people, it was interesting to see that many of the fans and supporters were black.  This was because I i did not expect black americans to be so into the kpop culture. This film goes to show that music unites people, cultures and countries and that you can't judge music just like you can't judge a book by it's cover"", 'The mixing between the Korean pop culture and Black culture is odd yet great combination. The two cultures have many differences but have found a way to intertwine and unite, which is the whole concept of America or the “melting pot”. Many Korean pop songs include english phrases or words, however the song is not entirely in english which is why it is an odd concept when it comes to non-Korean speaking fans, such as many of their black fans. One of the examples of K-pop groups that have many black fans was the male group BTS, and some fans explained they liked the group because of the added rap in their songs. I have heard many of the BTS songs myself and I do admit the rap in some of the songs sounds like American pop music, except for the language difference, which may have affected my opinion of the band.', 'I absolutely agree with Emily Gardner statement ""Mixing between"" the Korean pop cultures and African American culture ""is old but great combination. The Korean cultures is very different from African culture. So to hear a band called the BTS sing songs mixed with African American culture in it I was truly curious on how they came up with such an idea. Throughout the film I was hoping Nicole Fineman, Samantha Quick, and Logan Jaffe would ask the band on what lead them to combined African American  culture and their culture into their music? Another question I wanted an answer to is do they know their combining the two cultures together and If so how come they have not given credit to the African Americans? Even though my questions were answered it\'s still nice to hear people finding interest in other cultures.', ""The cross between the K-pop culture from Korea and black culture in America is something I would have never guessed, causing me to be rather intrigued. These are two completely different cultures from opposite sides of the world that have connected and made people feel included in something they love. The globalization of culture is now being blown up due to online platforms such as YouTube and Twitter as stated in the video. Another interesting thing is seeing how many people go to these K-pop concerts while a majoroty of people in America don't even know that it is a growing culture with followers from all walks of life.  That just goes to show the power of music and its ability to connect people."", 'I am not surprised that K-Pop is so popular because it is very easy to enjoy. You do not have to worry about the language of whether or not you understand the feeling that they are trying to convey. All you do is sit back and enjoy the music. I for one listen to K-Pop as well as reggaeton, even though I do not speak Korean or Spanish. I was shocked that there is such a large following of black K-Pop fans in the U.S. but it makes a bit of sense because we have our roots in hip hop and many K-Pop artists include that in their music. Unfortunately, there has been a stereotype of K-Pop listeners as being “weird” which is something we should eradicate because there are weird people in every following. Another reason why K-Pop will not dominate the American radios is because people want to be able to understand the and even its meaning - which is strange to say, have you listened to what’s on the radio?', ""I never knew about K-Pop or what it was until about a few months ago, I also never knew any K-Pop music groups or that they performed right here in the U.S. What was suprising was that these concerts actually get sold out. Also it was mentioned how 90's R&B is somehow heard into K-Pop music and how one girl was saying how she wished they gave out credit to that. I agree with her even though I never heard any K-pop music I could here in the video the BTS group singing some vocals and I got that 90's feeling. 90's R&B is the main type of music I listen to so maybe when I find the time I will try to listen to a few K-Pop songs and try it out for myself."", 'Globalization help spread and blend many cultural elements of different groups of people into something unique. American music, which is pop culture, is listen to worldwide so it is normal for other country culture to have some influence on the U.S. The African American people in the video state that K-Pop appeal to them because they can see African American artist influence on the music or some of their own cultural ideas in it, they like the blend of international music. I was surprised that there are so many fan of K-Pop who are English speakers because they cannot understand the meaning of the lyrics and it was intended for a Korean audience. The message you can get from this film is people should try to be open minded and willing to be exposed to different cultures.', 'After having watched this video I realize that you are absolutely correct no one freaks out that American country music is played in places like England or South Africa, so why is it such a big deal now for k-pop to have a lot of black fans. The people of world are becoming more interconnected and even if some social norms tend to be completely different in different places there will always be some point of similarity and it could honestly just go down to how they are simply both human and those similarities can create strange/random connections like this one, but in truth they are just people trying to express their individual love for a certain type of music and who knows the blending might be a lot better than the things being celebrated separately.', '|TAB| While K-Pop may be becoming more and more popular around I don’t see it ever becoming a trend or common thing. The problem is when it comes to its popularity is many people see it is as dumb or pointless and I have to admit I tend to feel that way. I really do not comprehend the point of listening to pop music you can’t understand. While some may argue “It’s not about the words it’s about the music” I feel like that really only applies to more artful styles of music like opera not pop music. Another reason I don’t see its popularity growing is because of how people view its fan base. While I don’t believe in stereotypes K-Pop viewers have developed the stereotype of kind of being weird people. And of course they’re not all weird people and all fan bases will have weird people it’s just they have been given that stereotype which will impede the spread of the music.', 'i also agree that most people might think that listening to it is pointless but there are many genres of music that do not have words and there are lots of people who listen to it. i also don\'t feel the need to listen to kpop because i don\'t enjoy most music out of hip hop. i wasn\'t surprise when one of the interviewee\'s stated"" they should accredit hip hop.', ""Although most of your statements do make sense Todd, I have to disagree with you because even though you feel as if Kpop is not becoming a new trend and is pointless, there is a huge fan base spanning across the world that would think otherwise. And again I also know that it is your prerogative to voice your opinion about people listening to Kpop without a clue, but listening to music is not about understanding it. It is actually about learning about a different culture other than your own and gaining a sense of respect for an individual's art. I personally can say I understand listening to music I cannot understand because I am an African American but I really love spanish music but that does not impede me from listening to it. When hip-hop was starting out many people were reluctant to listening to it because it was seen as bad and had a small fan base but little did they know it would spread like wildfire and attract people from every culture and influence other genres of music similar to Kpop. I think Kpop will make it onto the world stage but things take time to happen."", ""yea! I've never heard of K-Pop until this year. I still wouldn't listen to it though because it doesn't sound like something i'd be interested in. I also don't think it would become a common thing because not everyone likes korean music , but its nice to see cultures connecting with other cultures."", 'In today’s society, it is unusual to see cultures connecting with other cultures. Considering the culture of black people, they are usually seen as strong. Asian culture is usually seen as respectful. Seeing these two cultures connect is intriguing, as it is evidence that cultural differences don’t always separate people. It’s common to think that cultures with vast differences will never join together, but eventually something will show up and connect them. It is important to know that differences will never make connections impossible, despite flaws and contradicting cultural aspects. Our society of today still doesn’t understand that and still acts baffled when things like this happen.', ""I agree with your statement. Cultures are rarely merged together, which makes this instance very complex. It seems that the people can't get along with each other due to cultural differences. But if you put those things to the side then you can find many similarities between many cultures, which is expressed heavily when it has to deal with the cultural music of a certain group of people vs another group of people"", ""I agree with you that seeing these two cultures connect is truly intriguing. The fact that these two different countries can share a common cultural connection is something that people could act baffled about.

Now I go to university, and all this diversity programming has people buying into these fabricated or half baked realities of what these groups are like. You get a student from a wealthy white suburb who never actually dealt with the people featured in diversity programs, and they think what they\'re told is the whole story, and act on this impulse.

]",Modern tools of communication make it possible to spread lies with lightning speed. But conspiracy theories are nothing new.,"['Where did we get the term ""conspiracy theory""?  From the theory that there was a conspiracy to kill President John Kennedy. That theory has, 54 years on, been shown to be correct. The exact details may still be hidden from light, but the essential facts are all there to show that the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, killed the President is laughable. Thus there must have been, and was, a conspiracy to murder the President. But now the term itself has been twisted into being a put down, a slander, a mocking term to describe anyone and everyone who believes all manner of things, much of it utter nonsense, some of it very possibly true. Now there is no distinction between the nonsense (vaccines cause autism, Sandy Hook never happened) and the possible/probable (the 911 attacks were allowed to take place).  It\'s an effective tool, to twist the term ""conspiracy theory"" into a direct association which crack-pottery. Label someone a ""conspiracy believer"" and you might as well call them crazy. When in fact, someone who believes that an unknown group of people, possibly within our own government, may have been behind a plot to assassinate President Kennedy, is not a ""conspiracy theorist"" like the  Sandy Hook truthers.  The people who believe JFK was killed by a deliberate plot, carried out by more than just Lee Harvey Oswald, base their determination on facts, reason, and logic, bolstered by years of fact finding.', ""Pure speculation on my part, or conspiracy if you will, but I'd guess there's an inverse relationship between the flourishing of these theories and the state of education in America. Not to mention that they quickly acquire value as commodities. How many books has the Kennedy killing spawned at this point? Hundreds, I'm guessing."", 'Conspiracy theories are not new.  Kennedy assassination theories, phobias about Monsanto, theories in the black community that white people invented AIDS to hurt blacks, claims that Bush knew Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction...  what is new is that in the past few years, they have been as common on the right as on the left.  That is why we are now hearing about it, because it finally provides progressive journalists a chance to feel superior, or so they think.', 'Two years ago, in JFK related forums, possibly question were discussed. This is one of them: ========================== “There are many authors and people in America who contend that between November 1963 and Watergate, the trust of Americans toward our institutions was broken, some claim irreparably. People became cynical and reluctant to join efforts like the Peace Corps, or acts proper of democracy such as voting. “The tragic aspect is that even if the government acquiesced to reveal everything it knows about the assassination, there are no warranties that the people will believe it. “There is an initiative for the people *themselves* to investigate and solve the crime. Universities would be encouraged, in a completely open and scientific environment, peer reviewed to determine, as an excellent example, once and for all the physics of the violent back snap. This would be done by our brightest minds, with the government providing not only the necessary funding but a warranty that those scientists will not find the head of a horse in their bed. “That would be the only way for the broken trust to be repaired, and the healing to begin. “The mentioned initiative was inspired in ‘Ask not what the government can do for you…’ Your opinion, Madame Secretary Clinton (or Governor Bush, [whoever])?”', 'There should be an independent agency to question government gross mistakes as in the case of President Kennedy.  Government employees should be subject to be called upon until an acceptable answer is given or at least resolves the problem.

How can there be a conspiracy theory about something that didn't happen?  The focus of the article could have focused more on why people believe assertions that have no basis in truth.  To me, it is disturbing that anyone would believe that Clinton operated a pedophile ring.  It is a sign that education standards are incredibly low and that people have not developed the capacity to think critically."", ""Hi Norm: I'm not sure the distinction you mention is that easy to draw - is there a clear difference between a non-existent pedophile ring, and a non-existent government operation blowing up the world trade towers? What strikes me is that, according to my sense of how the world works, both are clearly impossible. As are most of the JFK assassination  theories. And yet there are plenty of people who find many of these theories plausible. (But I really doubt if there are many subscribers to the pedophile ring fantasy.) I don't see it as being a question of education - or at least, not academic education. The reasons they seem impossible to me have more to do with a general experience, over quite a few years now, of how plans actually work, or more often, don't work, how the government operates, and so on - leading to a sense that most of what people sense is wrong with society is actually right out in the open. I wonder if people drift away from conspiracy theories with age and experience?"", ""Of course, education is the key to combat or fears of the dark. to fight the dark, we need some light. the same light of Truth will take over fifteen minutes to get to Neptune and back, so your Twain's Boots must be tricky difficult to wear, indeed! Knowledge, curiosity, good faith, and honesty: share some, have some, give some, and live some and all will be well."", ""The graph in the video showing the erosion of trust in the government since the Kennedy assassination is very revealing.  When someone is murdered police look at who would benefit from the person's death for clue as to who is responsible.  Tracking the downward trajectory of trust in the government from Kennedy's death to Trump, also shows the level of corruption in the government, now at a new low.  Even the election is suspect.  Who has benefitted?  Corporations.  Republicans. Enemies of the people out to enrich themselves at everyone else's expense.  I'm just saying...."", ""The non sequitur of this article is that, if the alternative to the lone gunman theory is a conspiracy theory, then Oswald must indeed have shot Kennedy. However, from the Warren Report alone, it is pretty clear that Oswald could not physically have been on the 6th floor to shoot but be encountered by a Dallas policeman two minutes later on the 2nd floor, and have been seen at the relevant times by co-workers having lunch on the 1st floor. Even the Warren Commission admitted they couldn't find a motive. The Tonkin Gulf incident soon enough proved that suspicion of official stories was justified. That said, most conspiracy theories are indeed ridiculous, and thus may well be part of a meta-conspiracy to discredit conspiracy theories!"", ""For anyone reading, please realize that gs's assertion that the Warren Report renders impossible Oswald's presence on the 6th floor is false. Read it for yourself. Oswald could have been, and was, there. And Oswald could, and did, make the three shots, killing Kennedy. With respect to the Gulf of Tonkin, gs is on somewhat firmer ground. While the Incident did happen (from the perspective of the commander and crew of the USS Maddox), as a result of confusion, misinterpretation and nerves over a couple of sorties of North Vietnamese gunboats, the Johnson administration did spin it to what they believed to be their advantage, and Congress subsequently adopted that fateful resolution."", 'Yet another reason to increase funding for education & for media to be as voluble as possible at exposing alternate facts.', 'Great documentary.

No threats involved.  I thought it sounded interesting, but it was treated just as a footnote in our classes. I expected this puzzle to be harder than it turned out to be because I started out with only one absolute gimme, SEA LEVEL.  So I went to Tier 2, filling in things I thought might be right--TUGBOAT, HOSANNA, BARTER, RIBCAGE, ELVISH, FOREST, and DEMENTED, which turned out to be right, and MIDDLEMAN, which didn't. When I turned to the quote, LANGUAGE/S and DOCTOR FRANKENSTEIN leapt off the screen at me, and from there on it was just backing and forthing until I got the music. Total unknowns were DOTHRAKI and WORF, although the latter sounds familliar.  Unknowns as clued were HAYMAKER, EZEKIAL, OUTFIELD, and REGGAE.  I know from puzzles that the Alous are baseball players, but I was looking for a city or a team or a park, not a position.  Never heard of Toots and the Maytals. As always, a delightful outing from EC&HR.  Thanks to all."", ""I thought this might be tougher than usual when I was already at Clue J. before I had a single gimme (OINTMENT was the first!), but after that came a bunch of them (DOTHRAKI, GO-BETWEEN, ELVISH, WORF, SEA LEVEL). That was enough to tell me that the puzzle would have something to do with invented worlds, and it didn't take long from there to come up with DOCTOR FRANKENSTEIN. I think this may have been one of my fastest puzzle solves, helped along by having a daughter who had once studied Esperanto. Once I recognized the outlines of ZAMENHOF, the whole thing just filled itself in."", 'I thoroughly enjoyed this week\'s acrostic. My gimmes were SEA LEVEL, WARF, and GO-BETWEEN. I was pretty sure about OINTMENT, but waited for a letter to confirm. Also, I had the back halves of SUNBONNET and TUGBOAT. For some reason, I was thinking of a place called ""Galadriel\'s Tongue"" rather than a language, but once I had ESPERANTO it came to me. And fortunately, I\'m enough of a nerd that with a backfilled letter I got DOTHRAKI fairly easily. The puzzle was just the right difficulty: it required a little work with backfill to get all the clues solved, but recognizing letter patters in the grid wasn\'t too tough.', 'Burma(Myanmar) Liberia and the USA.  The only three non metric countries in the world.   What does that say about us?    As for Esperanto, if only every country had introduced it in elementary schools all those years ago, we might all be communicating so much better now, but all retaining our own language as well, as was the idea as I understand it. Congratulations to those who did make a stab at it.  Oh, the puzzle.  I had no gimmes at first, and really struggled with this one, but once I did a bit of research it finally came together and was worth the struggle.', ""gimmes include: TUGBOAT, GO-BETWEEN, OUTFIELD, SEA LEVEL, BARTER, RIB CAGE. like OUTFIELD best -- very clever. I knew the four didn't just stay on one baseball team, Most recent one was Moses Alou, an outfielder on the Mets."", 'This one went a little faster the some others recently.  TUGBOAT, SEA LEVEL, WORF are the gimmes I remember.  We were never threatened with having to learn Esperanto, although we did have at least one language teacher who claimed to know it.', ""This one was easier and faster for me than most of the recent acrostics have been, although I didn't have many obvious answers after the first pass: I had TUGBOAT, EZEKIEL, FOREST, WORF, and REGGAE. So I tried a second pass and came up with SUNBONNET, HAYMAKER, GO-BETWEEN, and SEA LEVEL. Like Beejay, I knew the zygomatic arch was somewhere around the eye, but CHEEKBONE took a while. With those answers, FRANKENSTEIN and DOCTOR jumped out of the grid at me, and LANGUAGE/S followed quickly thereafter, and then it was just a matter of going back and forth and filling in. I didn't remember ZAMENHOF's name, so bits of it were the last to fill in. It's fun when the puzzles solves smoothly like that!"", 'Nice linguistic tie-ins to a few clues, although I thought for a moment we were headed to sci-fi/fantasy land.  ELVISH and WORF were gimmes, and although I didn\'t remember the Game of Thrones language off the bat, I knew I\'d recognize it with a few letters.  I have no idea why one of my gimmes was HOSANNA.  DERANGED before DEMENTED. Both Esperanto and the metric system went beyond threats in my school, though unlike Jerrold I recall no Esperanto, and only ""it\'s a quart, and a liter bit more"" stuck for metric measurements.', ""I thoroughly learned the metric system on my own as a young adult in the 1970's, after taking an intense interest in it. At that time it was being predicted that it would be completely adopted here in the U.S. by the mid-1980's. The public's resistance to change is frequently underestimated. Personally i was disappointed that it never happened."", 'I was well on my way to learning the metric system too, Jerrold, with the help of my college science courses. I was also disappointed that it never happened. For a while they were even printing both systems on sewing patterns. Alas.', 'Funny and sad, Beejay, about the sewing patterns.  The only other immediate metric conversion I can do is ""4 inches = 10 cm"".  It\'s on every ball or skein of yarn as a gauge measurement (how many stitches using a particular size needle or hook).', ""Great quote! My sister found a class in and studied ESPERANTO as an adult. I hadn't realized it was that old. I got started with RIB CAGE, GO-BETWEEN, ELVISH, and SEA LEVEL. I soon got language in the quote, picked up the pace with the back and forth, and Frankenstein came shortly thereafter. Thought I remembered the zygomatic arch being a bone in the face, but it took me more letters to get CHEEKBONE. I was wondering if the Alous played together elsewhere besides San Francisco, and smiled when I remembered finally (with more letters) they were all OUTFIELDers. Wonderfully fun!"", 'Let us utter a ""(C)ry of ... acclamation"" for yet another splendid Acrostic from EC & HR!', ""This was an especially easy one for me, thanks to several correct guesses right off the bat.   I'm not complaining -- it's been a long four weeks.  It felt good to tackle a problem with a quick and easy solution.  :) Thanks, EC & HR!"", 'This was one of the better balanced solves in a while - lately the Acrostics have had too many gimmes in the clue list for me to feel as challenged as I used to be. In this one, there were several smallish words in the quote that helped me along the way, and it was satisfying seeing ""language"" when only the first G was in place. I really enjoyed this one. Add to the reading list the little book by Arika Okrent, ""In the Land of Invented Languages."" She goes into the history and theory of language invention and it makes interesting reading, though in the opinion of a Tolkien fanatic I think she underplays Tolkien\'s contributions.', '[SPOILER ALERT] My gimmes this time were ESPERANTO, TUGBOAT, RED TAPE, GO-BETWEEN and ROUGHLY. (I learned a little bit about Esperanto sometime around 1964, and so “unua” came flashing back to me as meaning “first” in that language. Wow, what you learn in childhood you remember for life.) I was surprised at myself for not knowing OINTMENT before getting some of the letters. I sure had to search for DOTHRAKI and REGGAE. The latter I of course had heard of, but I never heard of that singing group. Chest protector!  There is always at least one trick answer. I remember once reading about a professor who assigns the novel “Frankenstein” to his students.  He said that he takes off points when a student refers to the main character as “Dr. Frankenstein”, because in the book he was never called Doctor. The professor said “He got his doctorate from Hollywood”.', ""P.S.  I always read Deb's piece only after I have posted my own, and sometimes the coincidences are surprising. In my own case back then, it was a thick library book about the world's languages, not my school curriculum."", 'This is true. Victor Frankenstein is an undergrad at the University of Ingolstadt, and he proceeded on his science project without checking in with is advisors, M. Waldman and M. Kempe.  My colleague Esther Schor knows this, as a fellow-scholar of Frankenstein herself, but was, I guess, trading on the popular iteration ""Dr. Frankenstein.""  That said, Bridge of Language is a wonderful book, and I\'m delighted to see it honored in the esteemed archives of the Sunday Times Acrostic']","A couple of commenters think that the crossword puzzle was easy and had many gimmes, while another commenter thinks it was well-balanced, while yet another thought it was too difficult. Other commenters discuss new words and ideas they learned about from the puzzle, including Esperanto, the Dothraki, and Zamenhof.

I agree with the research that suggests the formation of children’s earliest memories are linked to when they begin talking about past events with a parent. Although I am able to remember bits and pieces of my earliest past events without looking through photographs, I recall the most when I discuss past events with my parents. Personally, I believe my parents have a more vivid memory of my past considering I was young and not aware of the world. “When four of us shared memories of our very young lives, not one of us could recall events before the age of four” (Gilpin). I agree because the earliest memory I can remember was when I was four. When I was younger, I lived near Toys R Us. I always wanted to be there to the point where I would refuse to eat dinner at home. I would eat my dinner to Toys R Us while I played with the toys. Eating dinner at Toys R Us did not occur only once during my childhood. This memory actually occurred and was not just a dream because I have seen photographs and my parents constantly laughs at this memory whenever we are together. “Remembering events only after age 3½ or 4 is typical” (C. Claiborne Ray). I find it surprising how I am able to recall events that happened when I was four, but not younger without discussing with my parents.', 'What Is Your Earliest Memory?

I find it surprising how I am able to recall events that happened when I was four, but not younger without discussing with my parents.', 'I agree with this opinion that we probably cannot remember memories from such that young age, but when our parents tell us something about what happened at that time, we will remember more or less something then. Just like what C. Claiborne Ray writes, “One widely studied idea relates the formation of children’s earliest memories to when they start talking about past events with their mothers” (C. Claiborne Ray). There is a connection between our memories from very young age and informations from our parents. My earliest memories is when I was 3 or 4 years old, my mum rent a “electric toy car” for me, I could actually sit in the car and started “driving”. I do have a photograph of it and my mum confirmed the memory. I know this memory probably just because it was really fun and I was just at the age I can remember something, and I have no idea about what was going on before this memory. In the article “Recalling Early Childhood Memories, or Not”, the author states, “For adults, remembering events only after age 3½ or 4 is typical, studies have found” (C. Claiborne Ray). Shows the reason why I can remember my first memory that happened at the age of 3.', '1: Yes, I agree with the research that this artical has provided. I think that, after parents tell their children stories of when they were younger, they feel as if they remember every detail of that event. 2: Personally, my first memories were when I was in preschool and kindergarten. I remember running around outside playing in my backyard with my brothers. I remember they I refused to play with dolls and I would only play with cars and power rangers. 3: I remembered most details from photographs and of other people, like my brothers, explaining some of the games we would play. They explained some of the ways that I got hurt or the ways that they would mock me and make me mad.', '1. Yes, I agree with the research that this article is showing us. I think that there is a connection between brain memory and speaking, whether it be in sign language or English. 2. I have early memories. The first dream that comes to mind is when I went to Hawaii when I was 2 years old. I know that this memory is real because of pictures and because my family went with and know about the trip. 3. My oldest memory was when I was two years old. I can still remember it now, but I assume I thought about it when I was younger as well. I remember being in Hawaii and it was raining the entire time. I also remember ""eating"" a giant pear. It was fake.', 'my earliest memory is when i was in pre school', ""I can remember being in my crib and also being fed in my high-chair as an infant & toddler among other early memories. I recalled the details and described my observations to my Mom who was surprised but it was quite accurate and the actions I described  were real and beyond my understanding at the time. ...including my older sister writing on the wall above my crib.....my Mom thought I had done it but it was out of my reach....when I told her she cried and apologized for blaming a baby for what was my older sister's  mischief.. I can remember breaking a little green chick egg cup while in my high-chair and my Mom coming to clean up the broken china & egg mess....mundane stuff like that but very early memories."", 'I would have to say my earliest memory was in preschool, I was 4. I would remember coloring every paper handed to me, playing doctor with my friends, running around outside. One memory that stuck out was the day I got told on. I remember being scared and hiding from the teachers, I even remember the girl\'s name, she was my best friend but we were fighting that day. Her name was Natalie. I find it crazy how I cant remember anything before that. ""Most of the participants’ earliest memories came from when they were 2 to 4 years old; the average was age 3."" (Ray,1)', '""For adults, remembering events only after age 3½ or 4 is typical..."" (Giplin) I agree with Giplin because it is hard to remember anything before I was about 3. My earliest memory was when I was about 3-years-old. I remember waking up really early in the morning to slide down the stairs in my pajamas down the spiral stair case and heard a noise to find my mom with about 6 puppies. I was playing with them and helping to feed them and I liked to snuggle with them. After i was all done the puppies took refuge right by their mothers side.', 'The earliest memory I have is waking up on my fourth birthday and barreling out of bed, being extremely excited, and happy to be another year older. I can\'t remember anything before that, my mom will tell me a million things that I used to do as a kid and I don\'t recall anything she tells me. ""The phenomenon was named childhood amnesia..."" (Ray, 1) I think they\'re right with saying that because most people can\'t remember memories past 3 years old.', 'I do agree with the information stated, because I talk about memories of my childhood with my parents, and the information stated in through and accurate, “The Henris published a questionnaire on early memories in 1895, and  . My early memories are going to Sea World when I has two years olhe results from 123 people were published in 1897”  (Giplin, 1). I know this because I remember going to Sea World, and my parents have a lot of pictures of me in front of Shamu. My earliest memory was me drinking a 16 ounce bottle of formula in my little rocking chair, I was watching the Wiggles on my T.V, And I remember being sick that day as well.', 'When I was around the age of 4 I remember it was laundry day and I was sitting on my bed sheets that were in a pile on the floor and my older sister started dragging me around the house. I remember laughing so hard, smiling so big, and never wanting my sister to stop. It was like I was on a roller coaster. ""Most of the participants’ earliest memories came from when they were 2 to 4 years old; the average was age 3."" (Ray,1) That statement is very true because I can\'t  remember anything before that memory.', 'I remember when I was younger I used to swing in my swing (crosson 1). I would laugh and smile while my mom would play with me. It was like giving candy to a little kid. I would stay in the swing until i would pass out or get hungry and want food.', ""I remember when I was little and my twin sister Lauren got out of her crib and tried to tech me how to get out too, but I couldn't."", '""When four of us shared memories of our very young lives, not one of us could recall events before the age of 4 or possibly 3,"" (Ray, 1). I can relate to this. When I was 3-years-old, my family would always go to my grandparents house. My grandpa was a mechanic and always has tools and car parts all over his back yard. One day my older brother and I went on an adventure. My brother found a suspension spring to my grandpas car, a few nuts and bolts to an old engine he had in the shed, and an exhaust pipe. We went back inside and grabbed some glue to glue on the nuts and bolts. We were making our little robots and drinking carpi suns. My grandma was there helping us with the glue. It was a good day.', ""The earliest child hood memory I remember was when I was like 2-years-old, I would go to my grandpas house. When I was at my grandpas house I would sit in a chair next to him and eat candy that was in a purple and gold small round box. We would watch television, talk about family stuff, and eat chocolate bars.  My grandpa use to say don't tell your mom so i wouldn't, but when he died I told my mom everything that we use to do and she just laughed."", 'The article states that ""...remembering events only after age 3½ or 4 is typical..."" (Ray 1). I have to agree, because my earliest memory was when I was 4 years old. My earliest memory was at the time where my mom\'s friend\'s house. My parents were at work, so they couldn\'t take care of me during the day. Anyways, I recall myself sitting on a wooden chair, eating delicious food, and looking out at the window. My mom\'s friend owned cows, and I found that amazing. Suddenly, while I was looking out from the window, a gush of wind came through. Two seconds ago, it was quiet. It\'s like there was a tornado, but there wasn\'t. I believe I saw a small tree fall down, too. The gush of wind only lasted for 2 seconds. I know this is such a random memory, but I believe the only reason why I remember is because I never understood why there was a sudden gush of wind.', 'My memory is like a history book. My earliest memory is from when I was about 4 years old. I think the older you get the less you remember. ""...  the average was age 3."" (Gilpin, 1). I think someone can have a better memory, have more rememberable memories, and someone might not want to remember somethings.', ""I disagree with the research, because I remember things that I have never discussed with my parents or anyone else. My earliest memory was when I was nine or ten, and I watched my abusive step-dad slam my sister's head into a wall, then yelled at me to go to my room. I know this actually happened because my sister got a concussion, there was a hole in the wall, and because I observed him doing things like that to both of my sisters all the time after that."", ""My son very vividly remembers seeing a woman kicked in the head by a horse when he was about 2.5 years old. He vividly described the event, which was confirmed by his Au Pair. (He's hated horses ever since.) My earliest memory was when I was about 4. I begged my father to teach me to whistle, and we sat on the back garden steps together. Unfortunately I couldn't manage it, and my father gave up on me, and it was never discussed again. But I never forgot the feeling of rejection from a father who meant so much to me. Now I've perfected a piercing whistle."", ""It might not be as early as all the rest of you but my earliest memory was when I was 5 my sister being born (like Carla). I remember going through the long hall with beeping until we got to a window and there was my Mom and Dad with my brand new baby sister. I don't know why 5 is my earliest memory and that was only 7 years ago. So that's my earliest memory. :)"", 'My earliest memory was being born.  It was very dark – and then, all of a sudden, it was light.  My twin sister was born about ten minutes before me.  My first words were, ""After you.""  I was a good southern gentleman.', 'I was three years and two months.  It was the day my sister was born.  I remember going to the hospital with my father and they would not let me go with him to visit my mother so I was left in a room with black leather benches and wood paneling that was filled with men, most of them smoking.  I was very angry, which I assume is why I remember it so clearly :-).  I have one hazy earlier memory of a man taking away our dog - I would have been about one and a half - I can see him walking the dog down the front steps but it is a very brief image.  There are no photographs of either event.', 'I was only nine months old.  I woke up trapped under a white sheet.  I can still see the whiteness all around me.  I cried, and my mother unwrapped the sheet and picked me up.  I confirmed the memory - and my age at the time - with my mother; I had tangled myself up in the crib sheet during my afternoon nap.', 'I was less than three.

I have atopic eczema, where my skin's barrier deficiencies allow staph aureus, normally harmless, to cause immune system dysregulation when the dead staph's endotoxin triggers an inflammatory cascade that is more conducive for aureus' survival than my healing.   Constant inflammation takes a toll on the body, using up resources that should be directed to thinking, moving, digesting, etc.  I would assume the most tired people are sick with persistent inflammation of some kind, and that the sleep is the body's attempt to heal, not a part of some disease.

Sleeping is probably the canary in the coal mine here; a symptom, not a cause."", 'Sleeping more than normal is also a symptom of depression. Maybe depression causes Alzheimers or vice versa.

Naturally, most of the right comes to the movement from the perspective of cost rather than decency, humanity or the economic benefits of productive, rather than idle, people. We need to understand that five years or more in prison breaks people who were not previously mentally ill. It breaks them in ways that cannot be repaired in the lives of most people. Rare is the person who comes out of prison and leads a fully successful life. Families lose financial support, children lose guidance from fathers (yes, someone who has committed a crime can still love and provide help to their children) and communities suffer when a huge portion of the males are locked up. There will come a time when long prison sentences, especially those for non-violent crimes, are viewed as most people now view the death penalty: barbaric. There will come a time when future generations look at ours the way we now look at slavery: how could a decent society allow such a thing? Until that day arrives, the goal should be to reduce prison populations as much as public safety will allow and to refrain from sending people to jail as a first recourse to problems that arise.', ""'' Jailing people is really, really expensive.

The author fails to mention the role of profit and privatization in filling up Texas prisons with people of color. And then there has been the privatization of managed prison health care which further punished the incarcerated while making big contributors and political insiders rich. Is it any wonder that the two men who were recently charged with robbing a jewelry store in a San Antonio mall, and killing a bystander, got their criminal starts years ago in jail thanks to relatively minor drug offenses? Things are not as rosy here in Texas as the author contends. One thing she does get right: politicians of both major parties bear responsibility for making prisons and jails big business in Texas.

Here in all its concrete emotional explosivness is the essence of what disgusts and is so destructive about classes in society. The staging by Stewart Laing is absolutely BRILLIANT! So brilliant, in fact, it might very well turn out to be the greatest theaterical experience of your lifetime.  The play abounds with his many spectacularly creative visual delights.  Bobby Cannavale, as always, is beyond superb. What a talent! He plays his role which calls for very demanding physical acting gloriously and delivers a magical performance. This searing play about how capitalism creates a snobby upper class that looks down on and abuses the laborers they depend upon is as relevant today as it was almost a hundred years ago.  Powerful, soaring theater at its very best!', 'The staging was magnificent. Too many words to express the amazement.', 'There is not a play or musical-and that includes the H musical -playing in New York that can touch this production.  BRAVO !', ""A production of monumental proportion with elements of surrealism, expressionism, absurdism and crushing pathos.  The cast is brilliant as are the machine-ballet choreography and stereo industrial sound design.  I did find it odd to be trapped inside a sinister conveyor belt with the liberal elite, watching a condemnation of the liberal elite.  But I cried at the end, I couldn't talk, it hit me that this play is about every person who has ever been ignored, devalued and thrown away."", ""Really powerful production in that amazing space of the Great Hall, but no one is mentioning the tremendous sound design! The placed effects thrown about the room from isolated speakers, the distorted and altered 1920s music for the bizarre dance of the zombie swells; the sound design was as compelling as Cannavale's powerful performance."", 'agree with everything in the review about the power of this production (it is memorable), but my enjoyment negatively affected by 1) the extraordinarily uncomfortable hard plastic seats which dug into the middle of my back and 2) the horrible acoustics of the brilliant space. The voices echoed, were overly mic-ed  and hard to understand at times creating an unbridgeable distance between audience and performer.', ""Because Cannavale starts the first scene at the top of his range and never modulates, his final scene isn't heartbreaking. At least it wasn't for us. And it should be. Production is truly phenomenal, but I thought it's style almost created a distance from the pain one should feel for these characters."", 'I remember the part of Yank,played wonderfully by William Bendix in the old movie version....,an unforgettable role.', 'I saw ""The Hairy Ape"" at Knox College, Galesburg, IL, in the early 70s, directed by Richard Riddell, who went on to a successful career in theatre, including a Tony some years back. I also photographed the production for him; perhaps somewhere those Ektachrome slides still exist. And I had read the play, which is profoundly sad and moving, before I saw it done.

Cannavale often has a winning quality to his gruffness.', ""Well, where were all you Cannavale fans for HBO's Vinyl?  He was great in the lead role, a real ur-Cannavale character struggling through the drug-infested hyper-sexualized music industry in its greatest days. My hope had been Netflix would pick it up.

]",A plan to build a barrier to seal off South Vietnam from the North was rejected as ridiculously expensive in the 1960s. But the idea lived on.,"['Back in the day (post Viet Nam...) I worked with some people from (D)ARPA. Brilliant in a Dr. Strangelove way and, quite often, very ""toungue-in-cheek"". I rather suspect Taylor\'s barrier proposal was not all that seriously considered, mostly due to its obvious idiocy...', 'Ironically, the real engineering feat of the Vietnam War was probably the Ho Chi Minh Trail.', 'Implicit in this article is the standard rationale for the Vietnam War, that America was defending South Vietnam against aggression by North Vietnam. Challenging this view are the writings of Noam Chomsky, for example “The Legacy of the Vietnam War,” an interview published in Indochina Newsletter, Issue 18, November-December 1982. Here and in other writings he tells us that the object of the U.S. presence in South Vietnam was to destroy its rural peasant society. (And let’s remember that the government that invited the U.S. presence was its puppet and hence illegitimate, making the U.S. presence an invasion, under the Nuremberg Principles a war crime.) The U.S. wanted to destroy rural Vietnam because it supported the National Liberation Front, and the NLF’s ideas for an independent South Vietnam, had it been allowed to come to power, would not have been in the interests of the U.S. As Chomsky says, “[The NLF] was clearly a nationalist movement — and in fact a radical nationalist movement which would separate Vietnam from the American orbit. It would not allow Vietnam to become another Philippines. It would trade with the United States but it would not be an American semi-colony.” Like the other in this series, this installment fails to address the fact that the U.S. presence in Vietnam was a violation of international law. Easier to talk about a technocratic folly cooked up by the “best and brightest,” who like their bosses were evidently untroubled by such matters.', ""It might have worked.  East to West just below the 17th parallel, sea to Mekong is much shorter than along the Vietnamese-Laotian border.  A 200 m wide cleared strip with watch posts to call in air support.  It wouldn't have stopped every infiltrator, but would have stopped regular North Vietnamese divisions, which are what defeated South Vietnam. Hadrian's Wall worked for hundreds of years.  Our technology is better."", 'If there is going to be discussion of the Trump wall in comparison to other walls, proposed and actual, it seems to me a more relevant comparison would be with the Israeli West Bank wall/barrier, built for the purpose of inhibiting unauthorized entry by unregimented groups of undesired persons.   Yet instead, we are offered a comparison with a wall, never built, that was proposed for a tropical climate where active and organized military hostilities were occurring.', 'Having recently driven across the old DMZ between Northern and Southern Vietnam, it is hardly noticeable except for some highway turnouts with pretty views. The concept of a North and a South Vietnam was always a Western construct and existed mainly in the minds of the US political and military leadership. I firmly believe that Vietnam is one country today because the Vietnamese saw it that way and wanted it that way.', ""There is mis-nformation in the description of the sensors dropped by the Air Force. They didn't sense convoys, they sensed heat. Water buffalo, groups of people, elephants and civilian vehicles were unable to be differentiated one fom another. The moral implications of this are obvious and shouldn't be over looked as they are in this article."", 'Chi My experience, and I believe it\'s reliable, is that sensors were ""accoustic,"" that is, they sensed movement (like seismographs do) as well as sound patterns. To confirm that I looked up Operation Igloo White, the defense department program that encompassed this program, and found this extract: ""The Defense Communications Planning Group\'s research and development program created an advanced technological system. ""Muscle Shoals"" (aka, Igloo White) would consist of three interdependent parts. First, there were air-dropped, battery-powered acoustic and seismic sensors.[18] The camouflaged sensors were to be dropped in strings at predetermined geographical points along the PAVN logistical network. Once emplaced, they would serve as tripwires to any movement or activity along the system."" I\'m relatively confident other designs were used in other applications, including heat, as you suggest. For instance, in Long Khanh province, our area of operation, there were intelligence choppers flying at night that literally sniffed the air for concentrations of urea and methane to detect the massed presence of men who had to urinate and defecate, releasing related aerosols. The NYT requires me to be polite about this. Was it effective? My infantry company was sent to bunker complexes because of that technology disclosed to us in commands only as ""usually reliable source.""  I\'m confident that multiple forms of detection were deployed.', 'The money to build the wall will be diverted from needed infrastructure projects. So a wasteful and ineffective pile of bricks in the southern deserts instead of repairing economically vital bridges, roads and railways across the USA? Is that really what trump voters wanted?', ""Speaking of walls, there's a black granite one in Washington, D.C., with more than 58,000 names on it that, rather than American genius or American exceptionalism, speaks to American hubris and the fact that instead of learning from our mistakes, we tend to double down and, invariably, repeat them. With tragic results."", ""Desperation: the mother of all American wars since WWII. Why again, please, do we call POTUS the Commander in Chief? He doesn't seem to command much in the way of military brilliance. See: Truman to Trump."", ""Technology has come a long way. Fields of acoustic sensors would be far superior and more flexible vs. Trump's Folly - even better if at least partly mobile. Though still a stupid idea."", 'The geniuses who want to build physical walls forget that the human mind knows no such barriers. Ideas travel with the speed of light, not the trudge of footsteps and the rate of cement drying. The idea of building a wall on the southern border of the USA is as ridiculous as building the Berlin Wall or this idiocy of of General Maxwell Taylor. All the walls do come down, especially the ones found upon diversionary thinking and erected by the likes of a mean-spirited Humpty-Dumpty.', 'Why are WE always the deciders of how other sovereign nations are to be divided up? Whether in Vietnam, previously in Korea, or whatever WE propose for the future of the Middle East, we have no legitimate claim to any of those countries. So what, beyond self-imposed American exceptionalism, empowers us to make such arbitrary determinations?', 'I do not know who the ""we"" is. Was it the Military-Industrial Complex that formed the ""we?"" Spiro Agnew\'s ""Silent Majority?"" The Unholy Four (Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon) who pursued a ""known we will loose"" war against Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to buttress their own political reputation(as uncovered by The Pentagon Papers)?  The we certainly did not include me, nor many of those military and all of civilian innocent human beings killed by the lies  told by those aforementioned. Aah, for the good ole\' days when lies were pure and simple lies, not versions of an alternate reality', ""In addition to harsh reparationst from Germany,  the Treaty of Versailles is a good example this tendency. Divisions of Mesopotamia and Syria ignored ethnicity and religion and led to present hostilities, thanks to France and England's desire for retribution."", 'Versailles demanded less from Germany than Germany extracted from France in 1871.  The French paid their reparations and were stronger for it, instead of inventing a victim complex.', 'There were many stories about these fabled sensors during my tour as well, including the fact that the sensors, dropped from aircraft like weighted arrows intended to stick in the ground and resemble plants, would pick up animal movement as well as human movement.  There were multiple stories of our listeners detecting what sounded like ""heavy rainfall"", until they realized that the NVA, who could readily identify the fake \'plants\', were urinating on them.  The wonders of modern warfare.  One can only (regrettably) imagine what someone as loosely tethered to reality as our current so-called president can come up with for ideas.', ""One ray of hope. HR McMaster, National Security Advisor, is a fierce critic of Taylor's actions as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which cut off any advice that the generals were legally obligated to provide Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, allowing both leaders, in collusion with Secretary of Defense McNamara, to edge into a misbegotten war without tangible consultation with the JCS or Congress. In 1964, Taylor replace Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. as ambassador to Vietnam. From this point on, Taylor and McNamara conspired with Johnson to hide the realities of the situation in Vietnam from both the public and Congress in order to not muddy the waters of Johnson's Great Society legislation. Johnson and McNamara continued to micromanage the war from afar using Taylor as the on-the-ground conduit to prevent oversight and advice from the Joint Chiefs, Congress and the public. The so called Vietnam Wall was a mish-mash of broken chain of command ideas, some by the rookie McNamara, some by Taylor who abetted Johnson's and McNamara's conspiracy, and some by the various service chiefs who had little clue what Johnson, McNamara and Taylor were up to. Johnson and McNamara both lived long enough to profoundly regret their disastrous actions. For the moment, there is at least one player in the Trump administration, McMaster, who is acutely aware and well studied in the folly of Vietnam and the likes of hair brained wall schemes. But political expediency often ignores sound advice."", 'I also read McMaster\'s book.  Too bad Trump is a non reader. I think that McMaster and ""Mad Dog"" Mattis may be the only competent members of the Trump administration.', 'We hope that as intelligent humans we would learn from our mistakes and either improve on the technology or design. We learned so many years ago, as the piece describes, the difficulties in preventing ""infiltration"". Our President would be well served if he would toss the bait used in his bait and switch campaign rhetoric concerning the Great Wall of Shame and rely on, well, facts, rather than fiction, and the lessons learned in one of our greatest fiascos so many years ago.', ""That I lived through this and nothing has changed, just astounds me. I have to reread this article. Who knew? Will read Ricks book. As an aside, I read his book on IraQ.  I was 20 in 1967. My life changed. To those whose didn't, you are the problem."", 'Toward the end of my 14 months in Vietnam in 1969 and1970 I worked in battalion tactical operation center. I was one of the RTOs required to get a secret clearance in the interest of even hearing and conveying some of the information that passed through. That included the use of sensors placed by recon units in abandoned fire support sites and along discovered NVA infiltration routes. There\'s no doubt that the sensors sent ""information,"" but a problem was that our area of operation contained a lot of animal life, some of it large enough to trigger sensors as would a human being. Whether the artillery fired on those sites accomplished anything more than possibly terrorizing the fauna and destroying the flora was never to my knowledge confirmed. Effectively the U.S. and S Vietnam constructed a barrier of combat units along the border with N Vietnam. They infiltrated through Laos and Cambodia, despite horrendous cost paid as casualties along those routes. And the NVA still won the war. Trump\'s wall on our border with Mexico is just another sign of failed thinking exhibited in trying to solve humanity\'s problems. He could spend money trying to provide those in Central and South America with economic alternatives and better government. The cost would be far less and more effective. http://www.theirishgolfblog.com/2017/04/eric-trumps-visit-to-doonbeg-201... He\'s a man trying to wall out the ocean in Ireland. He isn\'t sophisticated enough to try practical solutions.', 'Spend money in Central and South America to provide ""economic alternatives""??  You should know that such money has been spent for such purposes many times all over the world, all at the expense of ""economic alternatives"" for American workers - who, by the way spoke up last November.', 'Back Up So alternatively this new administration, like others before it, rather than continue to try to devise aid programs that will improve life in other nations toward the end of stabilizing the societies and population movements, apparently intends to support governments that oppress and deprive, spending the aid money, as one example, on ""a wall"" that is unlikely to be completed, or effective, and, as another example, investing heavily in the most expensive form of national insurance, our military.  Incredibly expensive military action is effectively another possibility selected by voters last November since, now, they have no control over what the administration will do, and have effectively encouraged military spending and increasing military spending. Good luck with your outcomes.  And thanks!  I didn\'t vote for this guy, but his being in office will ironically help me from a tax perspective. I\'d have preferred more progressive outcomes, but since I\'m entering retirement this administration will facilitate and enable that.  I have no doubt that a lot of people will suffer because of this government, but coincidentally many of those who will suffer chose that outcome. I\'ll never understand why they did, but it\'s their experiment.  If it works, well, what do you know!  If it doesn\'t, as seems probable based on past outcomes, the question is will they still fail to learn from that failure as in the past, or try it again?']",Several commenters agree that this undertaking was needless.

But...any biography (all two or three of them) of President Arthur emphasizes his strict upbringing and the moral responsibility his abolitionist father instilled in him; his extraordinary work ethic (even at expense of his marital relations); and, most importantly, his congeniality of character, the very quality that separated him from the more prominent blowhards of the era.  When I think of that, my optimism drains. And what dawns on me is not a sense of ease with the shambles of history...but deeper disillusionment."", ""Well, maybe I just picked the wrong one then. I've been reading The Bully Pulpit about Taft and Roosevelt. Great men and great visionaries. Puts me in an awfully depressed mood when I think about our current situation. I was watching some stupid President's Day commercial the other day when the realization that this reality TV star clown now joins the ranks of Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt really hit me. Sheesh. But I get your point."", ""Best feel-good presidential bio ever: McCullough's Truman."", ""I've just been making my way through several biographies by Edmund Morris.

While Washington's writings will never compare to those of Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton or Paine, the advice and observations in his address are very resonant today. It's unfortunate that we've forgotten the 4,000 words he wrote. His address was adopted by Jefferson and quoted by Lincoln in defense of the Union.  Read it. You will have new appreciation of and gratitude for the man that almost single handedly made sure that fledgling democratic republic still exists 240 years later.  Now, if only Caro would finish the 4th and final installment in his biography on LBJ...."", ""Words of wisdom. let's not forget: twelve presidents owned slaves (eight while president), a sitting Vice President shot and killed our first Treasury Secretary, Johnson bungled the Restoration, Nixon bugged the Democrats and, Clinton had sex with a young intern and then lied about it.  Indeed, presidents are people to."", ""I'm looking at the photograph of the presidential biographies and wondering why Benjamin Franklin's is included."", 'Would love to have your list of titles published here.

Like 911.  I was annoying my friends, ranting and frightened. I desperately needed perspective.  I wondered if Trump and the Mercer Bannon Brietbart gang were the worst.  I hit on the idea that reading biographies of all the presidents might give me perspective.  I have so far read Washington, Adams, and Jefferson.  It has helped enormously.  I just started Madison.  This column made me want to jump ahead to Arthur but I am resisting.  I recommend reading presidential biographies to all as a way of staying sane in the presence of a seemingly insane presidency."", ""I, too, am a huge fan of political history and biography---and for the same reason. History offers us a much needed sense of perspective and a way to honestly gauge the state of the world in which we live. Chester A. Arthur was a pitiable excuse for a leader, but spending time with James Garfield, a noble and good man if there ever was one, made him want to be a better person. And to his credit, that's exactly what he did. None of us is wholly good or wholly evil; neither is any time in our nation's history. Being able to discern that and see it for what it is is absolutely essential, and it always has been."", 'Another Presidential podcast talked about Julia Sand, who wrote Chester A. Arthur hundreds of letters during his presidency, urging him to be a better man than everyone expected him to be. After the election, I kept thinking of this quote from one of her letters: ""Great emergencies awaken generous traits which have lain dormant half a life. If there is a spark of true nobility in you, now is the occasion to let it shine...Do what is more difficult & brave. Reform! It is not proof of highest goodness never to have done wrong, but it is proof of it, sometimes in ones career, to pause & ponder, to recognize the evil, to turn resolutely against it...Once in awhile there comes a crisis which renders miracles feasible. The great tidal wave of sorrow which has rolled over the country has swept you loose from your old moorings & set you on a mountaintop, alone.”']","Several of the commenters also express the benefits of reading presidential biographies because of the helpful and informative perspective they give to current political events.

Cybernetics was a revolution that rocked the entire culture and which reverberates today. While the term has been diluted by appropriation of its prefix (cyberspace, cybersecurity...), cybernetics at least remains a placeholder for a discipline that stands as an effective lens for understanding human actions and interactions, human organizations and societies, and, yes, our relationship to the creatures we create in order to, hopefully, do what we want.', 'There\'s a lot of misuse of the term robot.

Fair's fair, and I take back what I suggested below, that tomato has no place (being originally a southern, or warm climate, vegetable). Of course for a hyper-terroir approach, perhaps one should omit it, pace those enterprising prewar ambassadors of Belgian cuisine. By the way where's Belgian beer (as a drink) in the 1939 review? No mention of it. One would think the Belgians would have promoted their reputed brews we well. Maybe they weren't reputed then?"", ""Well, as it's a take on carbonnade, not carbonnade, you can't gainsay it, but adding tomato, a southern vegetable, to a northern dish, traduces the concept really. For those wanting the real thing, omit tomato (coriander and cinnamon are okay but not necessary), and use the essential beer, sugar, and vinegar as the medium. No stock: to me stock takes away the essential taste, although some recipes call for it. Mustard on the bread, yes, added at beginning - it dissolves in - or at end as a commenter states. Bread should be French type, a little stale. For the beer, almost any one will do. Really. The end result doesn't disclose the beer character that much. The choice is more pointed when it comes to the accompanying drink. Beef carbonnade in the Flemish way is one of those deceptive dishes. It sounds like an age-old peasant dish, but try to find a citation before around 1900: not that many.  It's probably a late-1800s bourgeois development, when enough people had money to use beef in cooking and hence dish coming to some prominence.

That just didn’t work for me, so I sliced 1 pound of mushrooms (half baby Bella and half white mushrooms) and about three close of garlic. I added the mushrooms at step 3 and added the garlic at the very end of cooking of the onions and mushrooms so they wouldn’t be overcook them. We serve the stew over Trader Joe’s brown rice medley.

Sounds a bit bizarre, I know, but it works every time I make it for my son the Guinness lover."", 'Nancy - I have read in some Mennonite recipes the notion of chopping up prunes and adding them to a stew to enhance flavor.

As has been noted, using beer versus wine makes a different dish, neither better nor worse in prilciple.', ""Conversely Suzanne, would you use premium wine in cooking? If not, why use a premium beer? Par to the reason beer is a great marinade for beef, is because it softens up tougher cuts. I often soak top sirloin in beer for 3 to 4 hours before grilling. Suffice it to say, it makes said cut as tender as a wing, T bone or rib steak---no lie.  My point is that premium beer is made for drinking, not cooking. I've also tried to use wine for marinating chicken and steak fajitas, but it didn't turn out well in my opinion. Then again, I've also had purists suggest I merit death for not using strip steak, and marinating it in lime juice. They further assert that chicken fajitas don't actually exist as well."", 'Arcticwolf: Would I use premium wine in cooking? Define ""premium"" wine--or beer. Does ""premium"" mean expensive, and does expense = quality? Not always. The upper limit we spend for a bottle of wine is maybe $30 US. We buy what we like to drink; whether it counts as ""premium"" is not a consideration. The craft beers we buy, even the most expensive, cost no more than $3 US for a bottle, or about $7 for the equivalent volume of a bottle of wine. That does not strike me as extravagant. And if it provides the flavor I want for the dish, it\'s quite reasonable.  All ingredients should contribute positive quality and appropriate flavor to a dish. If they don\'t, the expense is wasted. Greater expense does not mean they will add greater flavor. But using cheap, flavorless ingredients does no dish any favor.

Try chickpeas instead of potatoes. Any leafy vegetable is worth a try.  Escarole of course.  I use spinach from time to time, but my grandmother did not. Flavoring is key. A few tablespoons of leftover tomato sauce with meat drippings. If you want to avoid meat flavor, there are many pepper and hot sauces to try.

Putting hard pasta shells straight into a soup is a no-no."", ""For all those complaining about the starch-on-starch:  you can always add greens, as the author did - escarole, spinach, any of the dark greens - plus any beans you might have around. The author also mentions tomatoes - can't hurt! If you're carb-averse, you can substitute parsnips for the potatoes and use one of the low-carb or non-grain or high-protein pastas that are now available. Another great way to add protein to a soup like this:  serve it with a fried or poached egg or two on top. Dishes like this are a good way to make use of small amounts of leftover meat that wouldn't be nearly enough for a meal but add flavor and protein. Soups have always been a way that thrifty cooks recycle and stretch food resources into satisfying meals.  Perhaps this concept is alien now that many of us in this country waste so much food.

The boys were young, thrown into a one-way, unjust and tragic situation and were never a threat to the Sergeant.  The suspense was ever present because death was imminent, just how much not known.   The emotional story is about the Sergeant’s journey, but the movie is shot objectively and key dramatic events happen with the Sergeant off screen (Sebastian and Werner with the little girl and the securing of the release papers) or are unexplained (were they not going to be fed for 3 months?), so the emotional impact of his actions is diminished.  The liberation was not liberating.  We were ahead of the Sergeant the whole way. Another movie reminding us that war is hell.  I did like the metaphor of the shifting dunes and the sequence of the boys almost ""flying"" over them.', 'Just seen the film and it justifies all awards, especially for the subtle change in Sgt Rasmussen\'s attitudes. A small point: his shoulder flash was in English ""Parachute Regiment"" (and he wore the red beret of the Paras).  The British 1st Para was sent to Denmark after the war, so does this mean that Sgt Rasmussen had served with the British military during the War ? And his German language was conversational.  I\'m aware that Danish and German are similar, but different (""thanks"" in Danish is ""tach""; in German it\'s ""danke"").  I\'m sure if he\'d remained behind occupied Denmark, he would have picked the language up - but then not served with the British. Any thoughts ?', 'Just saw the film and appreciate the difficulty of Sergeant Johannsen. Biggest problem was why was he tasked with the job of supervising the ""kids"" by himself? How is it possible not to allow ANY food for them? I was waiting for him to relate a dastardly German occupation story but none came. My granduncle was taken prisoner after he hid Jews in his attic in Dragor, Denmark and was tortured somehow, but we never here an y justification for Johansen\'s hard heart. Great tale.', 'On A. O. Scott\'s review of ""Land of Mine,"" directed by Martin Zandvliet, Feb. 9, 2017. I haven\'t seen ""Land of Mine."" However, reading Mr. Scott\'s review of this film convinces me that nowhere in it does Sgt. Carl Rasmussen tries to learn from the very young German prisoners of the Allied forces in Denmark, individually, why they decided to enlist for Herr Hitler and risk their lives abroad fighting for him. Confidentially, each of them would have told him that their elders were told it was a patriotic duty to do so. They would also have told the Sergeant that they didn\'t understand Hitler\'s Nazism or his anti-Semitism. They merely obeyed a call to duty. In other words, their minds were poisoned with jingoism and racism.For the reasons above, we cannot call the German youths in the film the enemies of the allied forces. This would add weight to the film\'s underlying theme of moral ambiguities of war. I would definitely watch ""Land of Mine"" if it ever makes it to my state. I expect it to rub my face in the slime of reality that none of the other Oscar-nominated movies even try to.

Hot on the heels of 70s hippies, tokes and spliffs, come the helpful neighbors and unlocked doors of the 50s and 60s--followed by a summary of the decline of certain Brooklyn neighborhoods with a dash of wistfulness for simpler times -- though one hopes this is not some Trumpian call to ""Make Brooklyn Great Again.""      Everyone is entitled to their own nostalgia, no? Ms. Galanter\'s poem, in a mere seven lines, isolates a time and place so keenly that you can taste it. The images may not be to everyone\'s taste, but they are true, real, succinct, and more vivid than the sentimental prose and poetry that purports to comment on it.      A poem is not an opinion, it\'s a living, breathing entity. Why not take it for what it is, what it wants to say, and then comment on whether it has succeeded or not?', ""I grew up in Brooklyn in the 70s.  I saw kids play in the streets and not come home until they heard their parents calling for them.  I remember the screams of delight from the truck that had the half-moon ride that came around. I remember that after running errands with my mother, we would go to Brownie's for lunch and eat our sandwiches in Union Square Park and watch the squirrels.  I never saw a rat. I loved the 70s."", 'I was under the impression that there was a huge mafia presence in Brooklyn back then. Were they the ones that kept the neighborhood all sparkly clean?

More hogwash or something.', ""Once, in the middle of the night, a mob backed drunken prizefighter drove down Sackett Street and dented a row of parked cars, including my fathers'.

My mother used to take me there for back-to-school shopping. I remember the Buster Brown on Flatbush and the Brach's around the corner on Church Avenue right near the beautiful theater.  It was a bustling commercial area (except for the churchyard, an historic island of serenity).  I don't remember the trash, but it is possible that I didn't notice, being all caught up in the experience of going there. I do know that I never experienced any fear or anxiety about going places or just being in my neighborhood, Kensington."", 'We once left our doors unlocked, We helped our neighbors shovel snow, And rake leaves, and mind the kids.

Crossing “Checkpoint Charlie” meant I (as a US Military personal) was only visiting our ally, the Soviets, in the eastern sector. All the restrictions and experiences I, or others in know have experienced as well. Ms Oyler did fully explain why the Funkturm was called “The Pope’s Revenge”.

So, the city has to provide police, fire and other services to these institutions with essentially no compensation. And home and business owners have to pay higher property taxes as a result. Several years ago, the hospital's tax-exempt property would have generated $10 million in revenue, a burden that fell on home and business owners. My property taxes have risen from about $14,000 annually to more than $18,000 in the 10-plus years I've lived in the Fairmount section.

Yes my taxes were cheaper in NC (less than $4000) than they were in NJ ($6000 in 2010) but people fail to realize that revenue for the state must come from someplace.  Property taxes are lower in NC, but NC taxes food, has higher gas taxes, taxes personal property (cars, boats, etc.) and many personal services.

]",The rituals for ordering wine can seem arcane and confusing. Here are suggestions for how to make it work for you.,"['I love all the fuss about wine and the ""rules"" of drinking it. Having been raised in Northern California, I have spent far more than my share of time in some of the best tasting rooms in the world. And, over the years,  I\'ve learned that there are really only two things that anyone needs to know about the enjoyment of wine.....First, there are only two kinds of wine - red and white. And, secondly, red is better than white. Once these basic principles are fully understood the mysteries surrounding the choice and enjoyment of wine disappear.', '""by all means ask the sommelier to choose a bottle..""  As a younger man I felt the need to select wine from the list in an effort to impress my dining companions.  I would always play it safe.  In my later years I\'ve found that asking the sommelier to recommend a wine that pairs with the meal selected has consistently produced pleasant surprises.  I\'ve enjoyed wines from small wineries whose names I didn\'t recognize, grapes I am not familiar with and wines from parts of the world I lack knowledge of.', ""If you decide you do not like a wine after the first taste, isn't the restaurant left hanging with an open bottle of wine because of your bad judgment?"", 'No, they can offer that wine by the glass at the bar at five 5oz pours and probably make a bigger profit than they do selling it as a full bottle.', 'As the other Times article notes, they can sell the wine by the glass and probably make at least as much.', 'Good sensible article, but leaves one potentially awkward question: ""State your budget clearly"". I am hosting the party.  I may really prefer not to state clearly in front of my guests that I want a bottle for no more than fifty bucks.  Alternatively, no less than five hundred bucks, or that the sky is the limit. Please advise how to handle. Dan Kravitz', ""In hosting a party or large group it is rec'd and often expected that the host will  pull the maitre'd or sommelier aside and suggest the budget and ask for red and white, for example."", 'Another option (if it\'s not possible to pull the sommelier aside) is to open the wine list and point to a wine in your range, and then state that you\'re looking for something similar (depending on how discrete you want to be, you can state ""around this price"" or ""in this range"" or just ""like this"" while pointing to the price; the sommelier will get the message).', 'I once read you should point to a price point on the menu in view of the sommelier and say something along the lines of ""I\'m looking for something around here."" I\'ve done this several times and they have always quickly picked up and directed me at or below that price point.', 'I once ordered an expensive Italian red at a very highly regarded restaurant in NYC. After tasting and pouring the waiter placed the bottle in another location. Later when the waiter returned to pour there was only one glass left in the bottle. I complained and they opened another bottle. Moral of the story; if possible have them leave the bottle on the table.', 'It evaporated:-)', ""In all of the biz meetings I put on in ExpAcct type NYC restaurants for 25 years, I always asked for unfinished bottle(s) to remain on the table. And, I usually requested that we would pour our own refills vs having the sommelier push more bottles with giant top off pours as they orbited the table every 10 mins. We eat and home and enjoy fine wine at 70% 'less' per bottle, these days. ;)""]","Commenters offer each other advice that they have about ordering and drinking wine. One commenter has a question about how to state a budget for wine when there is a large party, and several commenters suggest discreetly pointing to a certain price range on the menu to the sommelier and ask to be within the range. Other commenters discuss how they prefer asking the waiter to leave the wine bottle on the table to make sure they get the full bottle worth.",163,nyt,"Headline: Wine Service, Deconstructed   Keywords: Wines; Restaurants   Snippet: The rituals for ordering wine can seem arcane and confusing.

There were still bullet holes in buildings in the centre of Noyon - possibly left as a reminder of what war can bring. One of the best sights we saw during that cycle four was in Peronne (close to Noyon) where the British, French and Germans had ""repurposed"" an old fortress as a museum in honour of the soldiers who had fought in the region. The museum had very tasteful displays of the hardships of war without the ""triumphalism"" of many war memorials. My thought, at the time, was that the three nations had finally shaken off the worst nationalistic effects of WW I. Of course, that was before the ""Brexit"" vote and before this weekend\'s French election. It remains to be seen if the worst aspects of nationalism are really dead and buried in Europe.', 'The soil in this area (and others) continues to cough up ordinance from WWI--some of it still lethal.

He enlisted as a whole person, and endured the trenches, and lost his hearing there. Frank was not a citizen when he served. Frank lived well into his 90s. On each Memorial Day the VFW would organize Frank and the other vets in town to walk the Memorial Day parade. After many years had passed, Frank was the sole surviving WWI vet, and put him in the back of a convertible to ride in the parade in Fredonia, NY ... every year to honor his service....

These photographs are a wonderful contribution to our knowledge.  I hope the Times finds a venue for displaying these to the general public.  For myself, they bring a sense of great sadness at the harm done to so many for so little reason.  Most of all, they bring me a closeness to both of my grandfathers, who each enlisted shortly after the US entered the war and not surprisingly, though they did not know each other, served not far from each other in that terrible border of France and Germany.  I never knew my maternal grandfather, who died of pneumonia in the early 30s, his lungs damaged by a gas attack in the war.  These photos allow me to begin to see what they saw.', 'In April 2016, I spent four days touring the battlefields around Ypres Belgium, generally known as Flanders Fields.   Ypres, also known as leper, was subject to destruction three separate times as the battle lines moved back and forth.    It was rebuilt with German reparations money by 1930. Tall buildings of all kinds were subject to bombardment because they represented artillery spotting locations on a generally flat topography.   Thus, the destruction was tactical, not spiteful. One cannot really appreciate the horrors of WW One without touring its battle sites.  A hundred years later, there are still large craters, some now filled with water, from the war.  Men who were miners in civilian life built tunnels under the enemies lines, and placed high explosives there.  When the explosives were detonated, the earth, including the men on it, were blown hundreds of feet into the air.   There are cemeteries and memorials everywhere.   After the war ended, the German cemeteries were consolidated.   At one, there is a pit that contains the remains of about 30,000 soldiers.  The British placed cemeteries, conveniently, outside field hospitals.   World War One was a war where technology exceeded the military tactics to use those technologies efficiently.  The result was unimaginable death and carnage.  Its a sight to see.', 'One more point.  Tens of thousands disappeared on the battlefield, blown to smithereens or otherwise vanishing without a trace.  Over 50,000 British alone, missing in action.   Farmers plowing fields, or construction excavation, is still turning up human remains, several sets a month, a hundred years later.', 'Still the most stirring book on WW1 is All Quiet on the Western Front, by Erich Maria Remarque.']","Several commenters love the photographs from World War I because they provide an insight into the history and hardships of the war.

In my mind it says he'll take the easy road to a ring, rather than to earn it the hard way, because it will increase his revenues from commercials.  Superstars are few and far between and it is dismissive to say you are only interested in how they play basketball.  I saw Durant play at Texas and it was clear even then that he was no ordinary player.  Still, forgive me, but even in light of his professed love of his mother, I have no respect for the guy.  I agree with most players -- his going to Golden State to create team head and shoulders above all others reflected very poorly on him."", ""Look seriously and thoughtfully at your first few sentences.

OKC could have challenged for the championship this year. Now, as good as Westbrook can be, OKC is gonna get beaten by GS or by SA. And if everybody stays healthy, it's hard to see OKC challenging in the foreseeable future.  But KD was a loyal, hard-working player and a good guy. Anyone who hasn't heard his MPV award speech and wants to know what he's all about, check it out. KD's a mensch through and through. I don't see why he shouldn't have gone to California or any place else if he wanted to. Players have the opportunity to shop their skills around and choose to live wherever, just like anyone else. Cacciola is right when he says Westbrook is using emotion as fuel. I hope he does average the triple double, and I hope he gets the MVP, too. KD predicted he would someday. It might be nice for it to be this year."", 'Almost every basketball fan opposed LeBron\'s ""Decision"" despite the fact that he had the right to go to Miami as you suggest.

The Brooklyn Dodgers didn\'t trade with the Yankees,  And the Packers and Cowboys seldom trade.  I\'m glad KD loves his mother.  But he is a terrible traitor to OKC  fans.  This is like when OKC left Seattle, when the Dodgers left Brooklyn, and when the Browns left Cleveland.  There is no kissing and making up for some treachery.  Durant is just such a traitor to OKC fans.', 'Michjas, there are many intersubjective realities that surround professional athletics, and they are almost always good for the sport and for the fans. The overarching reality is that the business arrangements management makes with individual athletes, which are called contracts, allow for players shop their skills around. KD fought hard for OKC and seemed to reciprocate the affection of the fans. Treachery seems an overcharged word to describe a young man wanting to play basketball outside of Oklahoma.', ""But you don't know the facts and therefore don't know the truth.  Durant grew up in Compton, he played at the University of Texas, and he loved Oklahoma where he was the biggest celebrity around. He clearly did not do this to get out of Oklahoma.  So throw that idea out and re-apply your intersubjective realities."", '"" Last season, they extended the Warriors to seven games in the conference finals — and probably would have advanced to face the Cleveland Cavaliers in the N.B.A. finals had Thompson failed to engineer some late-series heroics."" Last season in the SF OKC series if Durant had played basketball the way he routinely does in any of the three deciding games OKC would have won. But he didn\'t and instead went to SF.  Durant is a great player who can go where he wants.

They have two very good forwards in Anthony & Porzingis, they have good guards in Rose, Jennings & Holiday (who I like alot), & lots of talented backup. They need more consistency from Rose.

But the Knick's expectations for him have not been realistic. He's not LeBron, a do everything point-forward - he's not Jordan who set example at both ends of the court & imposed his will on the supporting cast. The Knicks should look to Boston's rebuild around Paul Pierce (scorer supreme) who couldn't win it all until Garnett (the fanatical defender), Ray Allen (deadly outside threat & stretcher of the defense), and Perkins (interior muscle) joined him & Rondo to make that great run.  Melo is not going to admit he's an average defender, he knows it's his skill at the other end that keeps him in the lineup & spotlight. But this isn't his mess, he's been playing the way he's always played and can still deliver. It's up to ownership & management to fill their roles to see the big & better picture for the franchise. Either rebuild around valued pieces (Boston 2008, Miami 2012, Cleveland 2015) or get value for those pieces and move on. This is the worst off-broadway drama ever."", ""When making a trade, or trying to, it's standard practice to talk up the player you're trying to move. Common sense. Instead, we're treated to the spectacle of Phil J. ostensibly trying to move Carmelo, while simultaneously endorsing the opinion that he's a ball hog, a poor defender, not a championship player, etc. Personally, I don't disagree with those perceptions, but this is definitely not the smartest way to negotiate a trade. I doubt that the Knicks will find a trading partner, but one thing is certain--if they do, the chances are excellent they'll receive little or nothing of value in return. And while we're on the subject, even if he were available, Kevin Love doesn't make a lot of sense--not on a team whose 2 greatest assets appear to be Porzingis and Hernangomez."", 'Chance at what title? Sandbox league of midtown?', ""Anthony has been picked to replace Kevin Love on the All-Star team. He himself said he'd rather not play, that Porzinigis should go.

What a terrible waste of money it all is.', 'Think about all the bad actors the various pro HOFs are currently so sensitive about admitting, then maybe the anti-Carmelo claque might want to rethink things just a little. Charles Oakley for example , a surly guy with a good work ethic, is revered by Knick fans. But he never won a championship, despite playing alongside Patrick Ewing, who was by magnitudes superior to anyone Anthony has ever had the pleasure of playing with. Yes, Melo is often a ball-hog/gunner, but when your wing men are so bottom tier where\'s the sin in that? But around the league, nobody from the Commissioner on down has ever called him out on those famous ""personal issues."" Oh btw as to another consensus HOF player, Charles Barkley,who through no fault of his ow never won the big one (even in college) and whose credentials , despite his occasionally crude (but always entertaining) behavior, no one ever denies was the real deal. I think Anthony is being made a scapegoat here for inept management that includes not only all the usual suspects, but Phil Jackson. Who is ultimately the one who tied Melo to the Knicks by giving him a contract (I\'m sure none of his detractors would have turned down) that tied him so inextricably to the Dolomites that he will probably never get to sit, even on the end, of a bench, of a championship team. OK, maybe he\'s not  Jordan, Le Bron. Bird, Dwayne  or Shaq. but really he deserves better than he gets. Particularly from fans in my own former city of New York.', ""Few All-Stars make the players around them better.  Tim Duncan did.  LeBron James does.  There's no evidence that suggests Carmelo Anthony has that ability.  His strength is in creating offense for himself, not to play within a team concept.

They\'ve got a good young big man in Porzingis but they need about everything else.   Melo needs to go to a team like Boston or OKC where he could be the last piece to a championship run, while the Knicks need a young power forward, move the 7\'3"" Porzingis to center, and a couple of speedy young guards so they can run \'n gun.  The Melo era needs to end this yr.', ""Boston surely doesn't want him.  I can't imagine Brad Stevens would blow up his roster for Carmelo."", ""I gotta say, one HOPES they have a good young big man in Porzingis. Right now, he's very inconsistent and is not deserving of the hype he's received. But, let's face, knick fans are desperate for ANY good news. To me, the real issue is that Jackson traded for has-beens in Rose and Noah. Neither of them has lived up to their hype. Rose is a selfish shooting guard in a point guard's body. Noah is an ineffective big man. The knicks have guards, but no real point guard leader. Rose is pathetic, making players WORSE rather than better."", ""It's odd to me that Carmelo is being portrayed as the wronged party here. As inept as this franchise is, let's not forget that this guy, as a pro, has never been much of a winner. He's had some seasons where his teams have been good. But not much more. Denver had the most wins in a decade in the season AFTER he left.  The year he joined the Knicks, had been, up to the point he joined them, one of their most exciting in a long time. It was a fun, young, if inconsistent team, centered around Amare Stoudamire. As soon as Carmelo joined, that all went away. He's essentially a nicer version of Stephon Marbury. Or  a slightly more talented version of the original Glenn Robinson. I don't blame the Knicks for wanting to move him. I'm sure their desire would be to move Anthony, let Rose walk at the end of the season and his contract (or move him too) and build around Porzingis."", 'The whole thing needs to be blown up...Again!

Instead we seem to be stuck with a bloated, complex, jackass dumb healthcare system, that doesn't begin to serve our needs. What is the matter? Is everybody in the Congress just plain stupid?"", ""Forget dollar signs and charts and graphs. Forget political ideology. Let's instead talk decency and empathy and care.

Right now, we are vain, small and mean. We are earning our fall from the top of the heap."", 'This discussion needs to include a statement made by Dr. James L. Madara, the Chief executive of the American Medical Association: ""Although the MacArthur Amendment states that the ban on preexisting conditions remains in tact, this assurance may be illusory, as status underwriting could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable to people with preexisting conditions.""  Status underwriting gets a thorough going over in an article in the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation on Health Reform, titled: ""Pre-existing Conditions and Medical Underwriting in the Individual Insurance Market Prior to the ACA.""', ""As in the article, the Republicans now have, at least in Republican-governed states that will choose to get the new waiver, a return to pre-existing-condition-screened individual insurance with (still massively underfunded) state high-risk-pools to try and cover some of the people with pre-existing-conditions, Besides all of the problems of the pre-Obamacare state-run pool system: (a)lousy pools with low coverage max payouts, waiting lists, high premiums, overtight eligibility requirements, (b) the complicated process of applying for health insurance where you have to write down every out-of-range lab test and every abnormality and condition you've ever had and wait a few weeks or months to see if the insurer accepts you and how much they will charge you, and then possibly repeat the process with a different insurer,  (c)That insurers frequently, on getting a big claim, requested additional medical records, and rescinded coverage and refused to pay bills if they found a condition left off the original application, even inadvertently, there's a new wrinkle due to the Genetic Non-Discrimination act of 2008 ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/health/policy/02gene.html  ). The result is genetic screening results can not be considered a pre-existing condition, allowing people who know they are likely to get a disease, but have no pre-existing-conditions now, to game the system and and thus increase costs for non-gamers. (I wonder what Republican policy wonks say about that?)"", 'After my divorce, I\'d have ended up in the state health insurance high-risk pool, had not Obamacare come along just when I needed it.  I\'m 61 and disabled, with several chronic medical conditions resulting from longstanding domestic abuse (both child and spousal), however, due to a technicality I cannot get disability payments.  I have to make ends meet on just over $2K/mo of alimony, and I don\'t have the ability to increase my income.  (This all despite both a BS & MS in engineering/scientific fields.)  Currently, with subsidy, I pay $278/mo for my health ins — manageable.  But the Colorado high-risk pool that was in existence prior to Obamacare used to charge $1200/mo, and they were the only ones who said they would insure me before Obamacare.  There\'s no way I can pay $1200/mo for health insurance, my alimony disqualifies me from Medicaid, & I require several expensive medications to manage multiple conditions.   Republicans have no use for someone like me.  To them, there\'s no excuse for being smart, educated, hardworking, AND...have chronic health problems, especially complex ones.

In the article, Ms. Sanger-Katz points out that the high-risk-pools (which existed in most states pre-Obamacare) were generally miserable.   (Waiting lists, low maximum bill payout, unreasonable eligibility restrictions, high premiums, etc.) I note further that the Republicans propose sending states only a tiny fraction of the funding needed to make high risk pools work.  (They\'ve proposed $2.5 to $10 billion dollars a year, when more like $100 billion are needed--see  http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2017/mar/high-risk-poo...  .) In a  recent article, Ms. Sanger-Katz also pointed out that the application procedure under the old pre-existing-condition-screened system was slow and complicated: you fill out an application with your pre-existing conditions, and they get back to you a month or two later. Let me throw in a third fact about the old system.  You could apply for health insurance, write down your pre-existing conditions as best as you could remember, and the insurance company might issue you insurance, but then not pay your bills if it decided, after a big claim came in, that you accidentally  left off a pre-existing condition.

There I heard about the fort and an eccentric Irish officer in the British Army, Edward Nichols, who recruited runaway slaves and members of Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee, and Seminole tribes and commanded the fort during the War of 1812.  Since moving to the Big Bend area, my family and I have made several pilgrimages to the site, making sure that my daughter's education in Florida history is more broad than mine was. One of the more fascinating lessons we've learned about this place and time in US history is the way that enslaved and indigenous people's lives and rights were used in increasingly cynical ways to forward the ambitions of competing colonial powers. Andrew Jackson's role in such strategies and ambitions should also be emphasized: the Creek allies that Ms. Bentley mentions as helping the Americans destroy the fort were members of a once-sovereign nation divided by federal policies of expansion, exploitation, and extinction; Seminoles and Red-Stick Creek Indians fought against the Americans alongside self-liberated slaves from Georgia and the Carolinas.

Last year I was walking through Disneyland with my teenage son and my sister.  We saw a small group moving through Tomorrowland with bodyguards and the Disney tour escort (not unusual here).  The man was absolutely mesmerizing and many fellow Californians stopped to stare at his blazing smile, long limbs and shaggy hair.  I had no idea who he was.  I soon realized that Gwen Stefani was part of the group.  I recognized her, but she was a muted presence beside him despite her full hair, make-up and shiny black boots.  That man will electrify you in person.  Consider also the Blake Shelton references in the Amy Schumer episode that parodies 12 Angry Men.  I seldom see People magazine, but I'm all for women disputing their judgment of sexiness.  On the other hand, seeing Blake Shelton in person might change anyone's mind!"", 'Women do not owe men their beauty.  I have said for years that if women just stop spending their income on the unattainable demands of men they will reap the world.', ""While it may be true that women's curves often define sexy, I disagree that men's faces define their sexiness. Mark Wahlberg is not sexy because of his face. And when any lead male not in a comedy takes off his shirt, it is expected he should reveal a chiseled triangle shaped chest close to washboard stomach, and in America it should be hairless. There are expectations for men's bodies too. And it is a Michael Phelps Ryan Gosling Brad Pitt He-man chest. (Even the photo of Jeff Bezos in this Sunday's newspaper features a triangle chested man who looks like he would would look good with his shirt off.) Sorry but Seth Rogen will never get to play Darth Maul. If the dad body is having his day so too are the voluptuous figures of Mindy Kaling, Rebel Wilson, and Melissa McCarthy--all comedy."", 'It is interesting to me that for all the talk about ""The Male Gaze"" and objectification, on and on, that it is women who buy make up, who buy sexy dresses, who buy high heels (which have to be even more torture than neck ties), who support dozens of publications on everything from how to be the perfect housewife to how to catch and hold your man.   Can we agree that no woman should be forced into sex or a relationship she does not want?  That respect for each other is the foundation for good business and friendship, that teaching the incoming generation is good for the organization and must never come with conditions. Can we also agree that pushing sex into the shadows rather than celebrating it as a glorious part of life is the cause of much of our problems?  That if this were something that was part of everyday life, that much of the coercion, would go away? Our existing way of dealing with the relationships between men and women in the public sphere does not seem to be working.  Perhaps its time we looked at the underlying assumptions.', 'The sad fact is that ""sexy"" often means reduction to object.  Although the article focuses on the curvaceous body image, one has only to pick up most any ""women\'s"" magazine and one is struck by the anorexic, in some cases opiate addicted mimic, body form in ads for clothing, cosmetics, travel, etc.  Men are similarly judged, though a lot more is forgiven the wealthier or more ""powerful"" he is.  Thus, the origin of arm candy.  In America ads from my childhood emphasized the sunny tan (ignoring the melanoma that results); still does, but with some limitation.  In Africa, skin lighteners are sold, products which contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals.  Brown up in America, lighten in Africa.  The objective is to create dissatisfaction with who we are.  We need to accept people as they are, not how well or poorly they fit into some ridiculous stereotype of what is beautiful, or handsome, or strong.  It is a sickness that infects the whole of our assessment of our fellow human beings.', 'A bisexual friend\'s take on this (discussed a couple of years back): Straight men\'s arousal tendencies are pretty standard: Take apparent youth, a fertile appearing body, and whatever fetish(es) that the guy possesses and you\'ve pretty much got it.  Straight women have far more varied tastes and desires. Post-adolescent youth, good hygiene, a deep voice and not too short seem to be commonalities but after that, anything goes.  The point made was that most straight men find very similar women desirable but straight women views of desirable (discounting power and money, which when women posses them, don\'t appear to be aphrodisiacs for men) are all over the map.  Personally, this straight woman finds most of the supposed ""sexiest men"" not that attractive (especially male models who look bizarre to me). So I may be part of the proof that our attractions are all over the map.', 'No matter what is being called ""sexy"" male, female, automobile or home, it is always for the male gaze and that irritates me very much.  Blake Shelton is non-threatening. He\'s the guy next door that you hardly notice. And that is so men won\'t feel threatened.  It\'s as if women and what they want doesn\'t exist. It\'s as if women don\'t have jobs and money of their own.  The advertising/entertainment industry is odious.', 'Sexiness is an energy that comes from within. I think it is total complete confidence in one’s sexuality, self, abilities etc and perhaps it is being one’s true authentic self. Case in point, about a decade ago, myself and some girlfriends took an intro to pole dancing class. The instructor comes into the room. The instructor was a “voluminous” woman, think Venus of Willendorf with 20 extra pounds. I thought I do not want to watch a fat person pole dance. This was back when I was younger and thought I knew everything. Well the woman got on the pole and proceeded to move in a way that could only be described as true, raw, unadulterated, authentic sexiness. While I didn’t learn to pole dance that night, I did learn that outside appearances do not create sexiness. This woman had proved my belief that outward appearance determine sexiness untrue. If it doesnt come from outward appearance (this woman was overweight, may have been borderline obese and was not a shape i considered sexy), then where does it come from?? Its an energy that comes from within. Most people are a long way from accessing this from within themselves, which is why marketing sexiness is successful.   Regarding sexiness, marketing resonates with and exploits the self doubts and unassuredness “baggage” that block that beautiful vibe called “sexiness” that is in inside of each and every one of us. Until people look within for sexiness, there will always be a market for lipsticks, push-up bras and Rogaine.', 'The interesting thing about all this is the unstated assumption that ""sexy"" is mainly a visual thing. Understandable, given that celebrity culture is overwhelmingly visual, but probably deeply misleading, given that more and more research suggests that visual stimuli are only a small part of what determines sexual attraction in humans, smell and sound being apparently at least equally if not more important. Some research suggests this is particularly true for women.  In other words, if we really wanted to find out who the sexiest man or woman alive is, sniffing them would probably be more useful than looking at pictures of them.', 'Thought experiment...is a process of defining masculinity and ""acceptable"" masculinity going on in a manner now that mirrors the definition of feminity and ""acceptable"" femininity that we have been unwinding for that last 100 years at an accelerating pace. Another thought experiment...is masculinity in contemporary culture being cleansed and purified with the same frenzy as heresy during the Inquisition.

It'll be quite a revolution."", 'What Ms. Roberts seems to say is that women want something other than sex (wrong: women want sex too). Women have always more--sex and spirit and personality (not to mention intelligence). It is only that women have recently achieved political and economic power such that those choices are more readily recognizable.  What Ms. Roberts seems to be describing in hopeful terms is what the market will ultimately serve up so long as women continue to gain that power. Is it any wonder that all those iterations of the male gaze were on billboards, screens and commercials when female labor participation rates/compensation parity and political representation were and are still lopsided? We have a long way to go, baby.', 'There is a major difference in what drives straight male sexual arousal and women based on my experience. Most men are visually oriented and enjoy viewing attractive women. This is a major turn-on. From what i can tell, women\'s arousal is way more complex and the visual is only one factor. Not all of us are sexual predators, ""undress"" women in our minds or have rape in mind. We like looking at attractive women solely for sake of their appeal. I think this can interfere with women\'s equality in the work place. We males have to be conscious of separating out our emotional bias in dealing with ladies.', '>>> We can imagine deifying different bodies or a wider variety of them; we might even imagine a post-gaze society, where we lust after personality and spirit rather than external appearance.

How do you think the patriarchy controls her?  Blackmail?', '""Sexiness"" has basically become an advertising construct having little to do with actual sex and more to do with an idealized vision of sex and, as Naomi Wolf would observe, our frustrations at not being able to attain it. Sexiness is used to manipulate both women and men.  Men, because we swim in testosterone (at least during that period of life when we are a \'target market\'), may be more easily manipulated by images.  Women, because they\'ve been taught to be insecure, may be more easily manipulated by the dream of making themselves more attractive. Far from limiting the influence of sex, sexual taboos have made us more vulnerable to that sort of manipulation.   We are a society in flux--maybe permanent flux.  Technology (birth control, communications, etc.), changes in life styles (from agrarian to urban), and the influence of multiple cultures have all called into question our sexual mores and roles.  We will continue to struggle with this, I suspect, until more mature attitudes develop, if ever.', ""So what is the patriarchy holding over Anna Wintour?

While a condo board\'s approval of your purchase may be little more than a formality, there could be restrictions on home offices written into the condo\'s Rules & Regulations (as there are in mine), so it would be wise to review the R&R before entering into an agreement. How vigorously the Board enforces those regulations varies from condo to condo; certainly, prominent evidence of work activity (e.g. clients waiting in the lobby for their appointments, as noted in the article) would be an invitation to an injunction.']","Some commenters focus on the laws in particular, while others focus on what the user can ""get away with.""

I'd say that if I knew what I was doing on a surfboard surrounded by shark infested water, I would surely attempt to embrace this festivity during night hours. No one can blame these surfers for trying to do this, as surfing spots during the day become harder to find with ease, that glorious wave turning over on the reef becomes ever harder to find. At night it's different, only the bravest and most daring surfers attempt to surf the waters, but they do it because they enjoy it. They enjoy the peacefulness at night, with no human body around to surf in the way of their big wave of a dream. These night pastimes are very common throughout society, even with myself. At night, the stars open up, and I find myself gazing up at them for hours upon end. I love taking unique photos through my camera, and even better yet at night. I seek out very dark desolate places, such as Eastern Oregon, where lights seldom brighten up the sky. It is so peaceful here, with only the stars to look up at, and a camera at my side. It may only take time and a place for you to rest your eyes upon the darkness of night for yourself."", ""After reading the article, I don't blame the surfers one bit. While surfing at night is dangerous due to there being no life guard to watch over them in the dark, I don't blame them because they have the strong motivated desire to do what they love. I personally like to exercise such as lift weights and do calisthenics at night in my back yard. Although the mosquito's get the best of me during summer nights, in the winter and fall I very much enjoy exercising at night because it is very peaceful. Luckily my form of work at night doesn't pose any risks or dangers but the only thing that can hurt me is myself in regards to the weights.  I admire the surfers for taking on such dangers to pursue what they most enjoy, and the fact that they choose to do it at night increases the danger level which makes my respect for them that much greater."", 'I can definitely lose sleep over some things in life, namely my passions such as chess. Chess is an obsession for me, something that has driven a lot of my goals in life. It has changed my way of thinking and made me into who I am. I would most definitely lose sleep over chess; I already have. I\'ve stayed up memorizing strategies and tactical positions in order to get a better grip on an opponent, or just for the fun of learning it. I\'ve stayed up for over 3 hours in an intense chess game that culminated in my success. So, yes, I would stay up for chess. I respect those surfers who brave all of the bad conditions in order to pursue their passion. What they are doing is not letting the norms define them. That is something that I can get behind, and it is something that I respect as a person. That being said, as a person I am relatively conservative, and I would not throw my life away for a simple chess game. That is where I draw the line. But I can understand the reasoning behind the simple passion that drives these surfers and their ""eccentric"" behaviors.', ""I believe that the nighttime surfers are very brave to go out at night and surf. They suffer many challenges that day time surfers do not. One, the low viability at night makes it hard for the surfers to see what they are doing. Although they have made LED boards, this doesn't completely solve the problem. They also must deal with sharks. Although the chance to encounter a shark is low, they are still a risk and night time surfers need to be careful. Also, if any of the surfers get hurt, there are no lifeguards to help them. If i were to do a nighttime sport, it would be night skiing. I believe that it would be a very different experience from day time skiing and would be very fun."", ""I really admire and respect those who are willing to risk their life just so they can do that one special thing they love. It's dangerous to go night surfing with sharks, low visibility, and a lack of lifeguards, but I see why these people do it. When you get that rush of doing something you love, your worries sort of disappear. When I need to clear my head, I really like walking around outside on nights when it's raining. It's relaxing hearing the rain drops lightly plop against the umbrella. I also really like cold temperatures, so having that ice cold air brush against your cheeks is great. The only things you need to be careful of is, firstly, the sidewalk. The sidewalk where I live is not even at all, so you have to watch your step. Also, combining the darkness of the night hours with someone who loves dressing from head to toe in black isn't always the best idea, so you have to make sure cars see you when you're trying to cross the street. These things are a simple fix because all you need is a flashlight to help cars see you and to light up the areas on the sidewalk that are uneven. My favorite activity isn't even close to being as life threatening as  night surfing, but I still can understand why people can so easily overcome those dangerous obstacles for their own pleasure."", ""I am amazed at how these people are willing to risk their lives for something they love. It takes great courage to be able to face the dangers of surfing at night. Personally, I believe night surfing is a crazy idea because of sharks, low visibility and lack of lifeguard support. If something were to go wrong which is not unlikely, they surfer could be in serious danger. I don't think I would ever be able to risk my life to go night surfing. However, I do love swimming at night. But not in the ocean. I prefer the safety of my own pool where there are no sharks to worry about. I love looking up and seeing the stars and the utter silence except for the soft rippling of the water. There is something so peaceful about just relaxing and swimming in the cool water. I understand why these surfers risk their life, but I don't think I would ever be able to do the same."", ""The surfers who risk their lives to surf at night are inspirational if u look at the bare aspect of what their doing. It may seem like just a hobby to readers like us, but it is a part of their life they are willing to take drausitic measures to achieve. Most people know the saying you only live once, and that's exactly what their doing-- living. It may seem crazy, but to these people it's worth the risk to feel alive. I think this is inspirational. In the summer i like to run early in the morning or at night, the sunrise and sunsets are beautiful and that feels cool for what feels like the first time in months. it's one of my favorite feethings. Also i like to walk on the beach at night in the summer. The sand cools down and the waves are such a good background noise. My favorite activities at night don't differ equipment wise from when they occur in the daytime, except for maybe a light to run. — What sort of special equipment or adaptations would your nighttime activity require? Are these available now, or could they be invented? Why or why not?"", ""I think that someone who is willing to risk their life for something important is brave and courageous. If you run into a burning building to save a life then I have a lot of respect for you. But if you just risk your life to go surfing, I consider that to be a form of stupidity. But that's your choice to make, and if your really that passionate about something then by all means go for it. Personally I would love to play airsoft at night. The combination of zero vision and tactics make sure for a very interesting game. However to properly play, pyrotechnics and NVG's would be required, and both are expensive and the first shows great promise of starting a wildfire."", 'I respect those who are willing to risk their life to do something they love, but personally I think it’s crazy. Sharks, low visibility and lack of lifeguards are all a recipe for disaster. Although night surfing in my opinion is crazy & dangerous, it sounds like a lot of fun & would be something I would like to try at some point.  Even with its risk, I understand why people like surfing at night.  When I play tennis, I love to play in the evening. It is cooler outside at night, and the lights shinning down on the courts create an awesome atmosphere. The only difference is there is a 0% I will die from drowning, or from a shark attack.', 'I admire the people who take the risk of surfing at night. This shows how passionate they are about what they love, no matter the potential danger. I would like to try night surfing at some point, I think it would be exciting. I generally have more energy at night, and I like nighttime better, so I typically enjoy doing things at night instead. For instance, if I planned to go for a run, I would rather do it at night than in the morning or the afternoon.', ""Personally, I think the people who endanger themselves by surfing at night are crazy. You could pay me a million dollars and I wouldn't go out surfing at night. Correction, I would most certainly go surfing at night for a million dollars, but a hundred dollars wouldn't cut it. Maybe the only thing I would stay up so late for would be riding a dirt bike. However, the dirt bike in question would have a headlight, and there would be no sharks in this hypothetical excursion."", 'I commend the bravery and ambition of those who risk their safety to do what they love, but the peril that accompanies this specific activity seem almost definitive of its purpose. I fear that one would lose their life like Cooke, while, yes, doing what they loved, but also doing something that could just as easily have been done during the day. I believe that doing what one loves is worth losing sleep but not risking their lives. I would be willingly eager to lose sleep to do things that I love. This ambition comes from doing what makes me happiness. I would willingly lose sleep if that meant I was having adventures with friends or being a night owl at Starbucks reading a book. For some odd reason, I find motivation to grind out assignments in the middle of the night while. I feel this sense of advantage over those who are asleep. Of course, this motivation is only apparent if I happen to feel the energy to stay awake or am not able to sleep. At any level of energy, I am able to find another night owl to go on adventures with to 24hour donut shops. These activities require the sacrifice of my sleep, of course, but it opens my eyes to a new realm of the world. When it comes to equipment, I do not think that writing or driving to a donut shop requires any special equipment. However, I am always open to new types of coffee that truly are able to drive me forward. Coffee is the gasoline of life at times, and this becomes true when one decides to extend their day into the night.']","Many commenters feel that people who risk their lives to surf at night in the dark are very brave and inspirational in doing what they love.

Science is not just be how to solve problems it’s how to prevent problems in the first way', 'Unfortunately your article completely missed (skipped?) the primary reason that microbeads are so bad, which is that they absorb other contaminants in water that are ""hydrophobic"" and would rather partition to something oily/plastickey than stay dissolved in water (there are technical terms for this, but I\'m not using them here).  Of particular concern in this class of contaminants are steroid hormones, which are in wastewater because people taking hormones (birth control, other uses) pee in the water, and the hormones aren\'t removed by the wastewater treatment process, either.  Therefore, microbeads become a delivery system for these contaminants, which are taken up by aquatic life at the bottom of the foodchain.  Because these contaminants (hormones, etc.) are often also bioaccumulative (they aren\'t broken down in the organism that eats them, instead they get concentrated in fatty tissue), the dose increases as animals further up the food chain consume their prey.  Of course this long explanation is too long for your article, but you should have at least mentioned this.  If the only problem were that aquatic organisms were eating plastic, that wouldn\'t be a problem-- the problem is what\'s attached to the plastic that they\'re eating.', ""I was given bath products with micro beads a few years ago as a gift, I had read something then about this issue, so I chose not to use the products, but I don't know what to do with them.

Depending on whose figures one chooses it can be as much as  0.5% or as small as 0.1%. None of it determines 'race' (an artificial construct which never existed) or 'ethnicity' (also an artificial construct), but rather determines where our ancestors originated and how they migrated from Africa (and sometimes back again into the rest of the globe) out of Africa. If autosomal DNA is tested. only modern human basis will be compared with a particular data base of similar characteristics. If mtDNA/Y-DNA are tested, one's earliest ancestors and their earliest migrations can be determined.

The sad thing about this NYT report is the continuation of the MYTH called race.  Physicality is based on one's genes and locations on this earth; skin tones are also dependent on DNA-specifically in the gene SLC45A2 which regulate melatonin levels-levels which increase of decrease with relation to the distance between an individual and the equator. As the actual science of genetics evolves we will learn more about our ancestry and its travels.

Most of the city's Irish Americans were bitterly opposed to US entry into the war on the side of Great Britain, the brutally suppressed Easter Uprising having occurred just a year before.  Italian Americans, by contrast, were generally in favor of US entry into the war (Italy having secured huge and ultimately quite nettlesome territorial concessions from Britain and France for joining the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary).  Add to that the conflicted feelings of the city's Jewish population (the US was joining the same side as Russia, the most anti Semitic country involved in the war, but Russia's total collapse and the Balfour Declaration would sway Jewish opinion strongly in favor of US involvement in the war) and its Polish American population (who would become enthusiastic supporters of the American war effort as Russia dropped out and as Wilson's 14 Points promised the rebirth of an independent Poland) and you have quite a story."", 'Jonathan Rice makes important points, but not to be overlooked are three additional factors:  1.

President Wilson ran in 1916 on the premise that he would bring ""Peace with Honor"" and ""preparedness plus prosperity"" was part of that promise.

George is still buried on the island in an unmarked grave.  Will no one claim the body?"", ""This is one of the most riveting and complex performances on the New York stage - EVER. Do not allow Ms. Gates' surface appraisal and suggested innuendo deter you from what is essential theatre for any one who cares about the kind of work that opens a vein and reveals the emotional truth inside. That's what Mr. Dixon is doing here. This play is about what happens when dreams are shattered, and how one recovers by honestly facing the disillusion and dares to dream again. It is honest, deeply moving, and often hilarious. GO SEE IT!"", 'Interesting sounding show, and actually I saw ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" with Mr. Rose as the MC, but I was 14 and really don\'t have a clear memory of it.  This sounds sort of like a similar play that will one day be done about Bill Cosby. At first, seems like a great guy, lots of talent, full of life.  Turns out, apparently, that Mr. Rose indulged in sex with children, and that Mr. Cosby drugged women in order to rape them.  Leaves one with a sense that whatever bad things happen to either man after that, they deserve them. But it also brings up the question, can one appreciate the skilled entertainment of somebody and, at the same time, dislike them for their immoral acts?  Sometimes yes, I think, I still like the works of Picasso and many movies of Sean Connery, and apparently they were both abusive misogynists.', 'Note too how some comments defended Mr. Rose against these allegations of use of child prostitutes.  Some people also defend Roman Polanski.  I myself made the mistake of defending Cosby initially.  I think history tends to get less kind to such men.', 'Your point Mr. Stockhouse is so off the mark it should probably not even be noted. You condem Rose, Cosby,  Picasso and even Sean Connery of immoral acts  and being  ""abusive misogynists"" without firm fact just ""apparently"". In any case, Rose and Cosby\'s cases are totally different. Never does GEORGIE accuse Mr. Rose of having sex with minors, just seeking their company. Although it DOES acknowledge in  the culture  and country were the relationship occurs it is accepted, never openly,  as longstanding financial necessity for the families of these boys.  Dixon, the playwright, makes that quite clear: Everybody, every age there was for sale in order to just survive and that Rose never used drugs himself or with any sexual partner of any age.  We, the audience, only know he bought the child as his heir,  gaving the boy\'s family a substantial amount of money.  The family again did not kill Rose in savage way they did because of anything to do with Rose sexually molesting anyone, but that their gravy train may be ending.  NO reason for them to beat Rose for hours, sexual molestor or not. NO one deserves that. Ever. I\'ll leave Cosby to defend when that play is written.  But I ask you this: ""what did all those girls go to Hefner\'s parties for? Ice cream and cake?""', 'Apparently their defense of Mr. Rose comes down to the fact that there were no videos of him molesting poor children. That says it all.

No one gets away clean?"", 'Just reading about this ""show"" makes you seriously wonder about the boundries of Good Taste -not to mention True Friendship.  And the phrase, ""ANYTHING for a buck!"" also comes to mind.  Let our Great Talents RIP.', 'Ms. Gates, must say I am a bit surprised at your lack of journalistic skills.  You should have researched the fact BEFORE writing this attempt at a review, that Mr. Rose was murdered not by the underage boy - but by the boy\'s father, and uncles.  And not because of ANY sexual relationship between the boy and Rose, but because they feared Rose was tiring of the young man and would seek the company of a younger man than their son/nephew.  A point made clear in the play. Times Editor: Charles Isherwood would never have made such a gaffe. You got rid of the wrong critic. BTW, ""Georgie"" is a delightfully funny tribute to George Rose, his talents and the somber reality that the Auntie Mames off the world don\'t always have happy endings.   Anyone who enjoys taking in the well honed acting of a life on stage, will thoroughly enjoy Mr.Dixon\'s tribute. GO.', 'I didn\'t leave confused or disillusioned, nor did I feel it necessary for Gates to comment that some theater-industry folk question Mr. Dixon\'s account of Rose\'s predilection.  This was a startling and thought-provoking evening of theater and I do believe the intention of the playwright was to illuminate that people are not always who they appear to be, and in the callowness of his youth it was easy to be flattered and seduced by the sheer charisma of someone like Rose, only years later to realize that Rose was a seriously disturbed man.  But also, I think, as Dixon takes us back in time to the seventies and his particular trajectory as a gay man, a reminder that shame ingrained in his generation and the generation before.    Dixon\'s honesty made this one of the most riveting evenings I have experienced in the theater and I left with the reminder that we all carry secrets that when revealed remind us of our base humanity.  A lot to think about, to be sure and certainly more than disturbing.   All that theater is meant to do.   Umbrage is also taken with your headline ""His Unhappy End.""  Rose was tortured and murdered, plain and simple.', ""Wow, this reviewer not only manages to spoil the devastating surprises this play has in store, she fails to even think about what they mean. The darkness of Rose's death isn't a flaw in the play, it's the core of it, and Dixon has made something richly ambivalent out of his struggle to understand his friend. Both the brilliant light and the sordid blindness existed in the same complicated man, and the play is about Dixon's coming to terms with both in order to move on."", 'I don\'t know what show Ms Gates saw, but I wasn\'t left ""confused and disillusioned""--nor was anyone around me.  I was left with the wonder of great artistry in acting and storytelling, and Mr. Dixon\'s recounting a friendship with a brilliant, flawed friend.  The epilogue brings us back to the present with the additional perspective of a lifetime of  experiences behind it.  Not disillusioned in the least, but marveling at his having experienced all of this, and being able to recount it in such superb detail.

The rule of law requires courts to uphold these principles and to protect the rights they articulate. In a rights-based constitutional democracy, no person is sovereign and no majoritarian decision is above the rule of law. Trump's populism attempts to bypass the rule of law and the normal institutional checks and balances of representative democracy.

The drugs that flow across the Mexican border and are distributed by gangs like MS-13 are destroying our small towns in America. Unaccompanied minors are a concern, and to think what that permanent lack of parental guidance during adolescence  will wrought over the longer term is worrisome and must be addressed.

In recent years the MS13 Gang became established here and murdered several individuals, one being Ms. Rodriguez' daughter. A former Federal Prosecutor in NYC, named Sini became Suffolk County Police Commissioner. Last year, both Attorney General Sessions and Trump visited Brentwood and met with Police Commissioner Sini and other officials to bring light to the violence. Soon after  that, Commissioner Sini ran for and won the position of County District Attorney. Sini also had Ms. Rodriguez on his transition team. The anti-Hispanic bigotry is spreading fast. I hear some of it and it reminds me of the 1930's German rhetoric. I anticipate Ms. Rodriguez will be used to build further hatred and anger towards Hispanics. She's a fool for allowing herself to be used by these bigots as she herself is Puerto Rican. I in no way sympathize with the MS13 gangs but wish to bring light to the fact that a program of hateful propaganda is being perpetuated here.

While I cannot speak directly about the ""muster time"" of police officers or the exact ridership of bus lines, I\'m generally confident that police officers probably need 35 minutes to get themselves ready to face a long day\'s work protecting our city and its citizens (it\'s not helpful that the article does not indicate what this time entails), and that should there be bus routes that are under-utilized, there are certainly others that would benefit from increased service and we may benefit from a shift in service, not a reduction in buses overall. I take particular issue with the ""96,000 days of teacher absences,"" with the not-so-subtle inference that this is an outrageously high number. Of course, the article does not state that there are 75,000 public school teachers in the city. Which means that, on average, the usual NYC school teacher is absent at most 2 days out of the year. Two. So let\'s quell this hysteria about municipal workers bankrupting our great city.

Second idea -- dramatically raise the transfer tax on all residential real estate sales in excess of $10 mn. and extend it to the purchase of apartments in new projects.', 'NY should do what virtually every other city does and create resident parking permits. If the city charged $75 per year for a one-borough permit and $100 for a five-borough permit, it would raise millions of dollars that can be spent on infrastructure. It would allow for charging 24 hour/parking fees for out-of-town vehicles through the either muni-meter or cell phone payment. In addtiion, it would put an end to fraudulent car registration by city residents with second homes in  states with cheaper insurance. The permits would thus create three different sources of revenue, including sharing of cost by non-residents who use the infrastructure (think Jersey beaches).', 'You can tax every last breath a NY-er takes and there\'s still be a budget shortfall.

]","The notorious Aokigahara Forest looms large for Japan, with its high national suicide rate, though patrols and other steps are helping lower the toll.","['If you hang yourself from a tree in a famous place for suicides you have pretty much relinquished any claims for privacy.', 'It is time we took the onus off of suicide. Suicide committing persons are not, necessarily, ""pathological"" or ""mentally ill"". Suicide is often merely a way of assuring that one dies as one wishes to, rather than in some involuntary and often painful process, as is so much more often the case. If we really wish to reduce suicides, we need only legally assure all that a peaceful, comfortable and even ""blissful"" self-controlled, ""delivery"" is and will be available when we want it. With our drugs, this is certainly available. We do not ""own"" the lives of others, but we DO own OUR OWN. We are all going that way at any rate. Most of the opposition to suicide is from persons and organizations of those persons that are depressed and fearful of what suicide honestly says about the true value of a life of struggle, ending only in death.', 'We saw ""The Sea of Trees"" about this forest; it was not a great film, but it left me with a balanced impression of this place, albeit no desire to go there. As John said, many people who attempt suicide and fail realize that they would really rather not die after all. I wonder how many people wander into the sea of trees and realize the same thing?', 'The rate of suicide in Japan is somewhat higher than in the US, but if you take into account the rate of drug overdosing that is not counted as suicide, and where the US far surpasses any other country on Earth by a huge margin, the US comes out ahead of Japan in self-inflicted death rate.', '""Suicide is painless"" happens only in movies. Of course people who resort to suicide (or homicide in some instances like suicide by cops) are in tremendous pain. It is not necessarily physical pain. Psychic pain is much more potent. Decades ago I was giving a talk about suicide at a community center and one guy challenged me asking what if a person first dope himself up before sliding his waist in a bath. Obviously, he was trying to make a case. My response was that it is not necessarily the act itself but what leading to it. To back up a bit, I was a volunteer at a hotline service at the time billing itself as a general purpose suicide prevention organization.  Anyway, the org I represented at the time had no qualm with people like Hemlock Society. There is a difference between suicide (or suicide driven homicide) and euthanasia. So much so that the goal of suicide prevention is to de-mythify it. Stuff like my suicide is a way to strike back at someone or some sort of beautiful scene after death. But in fact the act of suicide could hurt your loved ones more than your enemies. And there is nothing beautiful about a dead corpse hanging or blowing your brain out. So sure, people need to dis-associate a 1,100-year-old forest from suicide. That said, they also need to address the phenomenon like copycat suicide in high school. The topic is suicide, not the forest', 'A man who survived a plunge into San Francisco Bay from the Golden Gate Bridge reportedly said, ""Right after I jumped I realized that all the problems in my life were manageable except for the fact that I had just jumped off a bridge.""', ""I remember him (or another survivor) saying they regretted jumping the moment their feet left the bridge.  I've thought about that often when I hear of a suicide."", 'Japanese culture both past(going back some 1,000 years) and present are famous for two things: suicide and misogyny.  One only needs to watch most Japanese movies, especially pre-2000, we see the degradation of women often with women either murdered or comitting suicide.  Those Edo and pre-Edo period films are very revealing, so too the films and TV shows dealing with life from 1870 onwards; the yakuza films come into mind along with films dealing with the daily grind of post/pre WW2 Japan.  Kamikaze planes during WW2, and of course that famous line from the 1967 James Bond flick- ""You Only Live Twice"", where the head of Japanese Secret Service says to Bond, ""In Japan, men come first, women come second.""  Films by  Kurasawa, Ozu, Naruse, Suzuki, Oshima and Imamura should englighten most Westerners on the Japanese mentality, even in today\'s society.', 'Topics like this invariably bring out cultural or social explanations: Japanese, or Asians, are uniquely this or uniquely that. Yet, the OECD data shows that Lithuania had the highest suicide rate, followed by (in order) South Korea, Slovenia, Hungary, Japan, and Latvia. Following closely are Belgium and Iceland that are often seen as happiest and healthiest places in the world. Even in places like Lithuania and South Korea where suicides are relatively very high, it still remains extremely rare (34.8 per 100,000 per year in Lithuania in 2013). Rather than looking to cultural factors or attitudes toward mental health issues, it might be more productive to examine how suicides are reported and identify specific policies that alter the rates year over year to reduce the number for a specific country. OECD data shows that South Africa and Turkey have astonishingly low suicide rates (1.3 and 2.7 respectively). Clearly, South Africans are not more than 10 times happier than Belgians (rate of 16.2) nor is South African mental health program 10 times more effective: South Africa has 15 times the murder rate of Belgium (34 to 1.9). With all this, variability in the quality of reporting and data collection make suicide data a bad place to start meaningful debates about culture and health.', ""At last, a reasonable comment. Different cultures express their sadness/frustrations/anger in different ways. The desolation that produces suicide is awful. And there's no questioning the scarcity of good-quality mental health care in Japan and the reluctance of people to seek it (often enabled in their problems by their family). Americans tend to express their frustrations as violence towards others, no great thing in a country awash in guns."", ""“Life is a precious thing that your parents gave to you,” the signs read. They need to change that sign. It may state what the society wants to believe, but in so doing it reveals something deeper about the social problem of suicide. Parents are the pysical generators of the body. They give you your physical essence. But many parents give nothing else which is positive. Often they are abusive. An understanding of human psychology reveals that most prisons are filled with adult survivors of child abuse. Many walk the streets freely as well. The last thing you should remind them of when considering suicide is their parents. It is possible to be life affirming and loving without parents, or inspite of unloving and harmful parents — but Japanese society clearly doesn't want to face that reality or the deeper problems behind it, hence the patriarchal bromide and command to obey family taboo (honor and obey the parents NO MATTER WHAT), chosen for the sign."", 'Arthur, I thought the same but slightly more grim ~ as a survivor of abuse & attempted suicide, that sign would push me right back into despair.', ""The photos of the forest are so beautiful I would think that entering it would make one think twice, even if ever so slightly, about the decision to end one's own life."", 'If the Japanese government truly wanted to slow the rate of suicide, it would include comprehensive mental health services in its national health insurance. Anything less is lip service.', ""Mental health services ARE included in national health insurance. The problem is that not all mental health doctors are part of the system, so options can be limited. Then there simply aren't enough doctors. Finally, people tend not to make use of what services there are. That's the biggest problem. It's still seen as a stigma, the way it was in the US in the 50s or so."", ""Don't limit this to Japan or the United States.  The entire industrialized world could do far better when it comes to mental health. Here in The Netherlands, it's a documented fact that the police spend 80% of their time dealing with mentally disturbed people.  In the meantime, in the more than ten years that Mark Rutte has been Prime Minister, the government has dramatically reduced financial support for treatment and support of mental health programs."", 'Ironic that the NRA and GOP supporters says the remedy for mass shootings is mental health counseling (vs gun control), yet we know which party would most oppose expanded Health Care,', ""I think a lot of the suicide problem in Japan is hinted at pretty strongly in the article, but maybe nobody wants to come out and say it. Japan has a long cultural history of considering honor to be paramount.  It's a very different mindset than in American culture; in America we tend to think of ourselves first, then family and friends, then the state, for priorities and moral guidance.  In Japan it's more the state first, then family, then one's self last. So if people feel they've brought dishonor to their family or the state, the urge to cleanse that sin with suicide is pretty strong in that culture.  In ours, it's non-existent, because of our reversed priorities; in America people generally commit suicide because of their own personal pain, not shaming their families. Additionally, Japanese culture, as mentioned, is very disparaging of mental health treatment.  People are supposed to be strong, wall off their feelings inside themselves, and not bother anyone with them.  Of course, sometimes it's impossible to be that strong, and that's when suicide starts looking like a release from an unlivable life. So fighting against the suicide rate in Japan is going to be difficult, as it will mean changing the culture around somewhat.  Luckily cultures can and do change, and in the meantime, things like the special patrol in this article can only help."", 'those relic social norms have been hard to eradicate.  The post WW2 reforms pushed forward by Gen. Douglas Macarthur were not enough, it was a starting point but with a culture based on a 1,000 year old tradition more needed to be done. This ""honor"" code is so antiquated, so regressive,  so insensitive and rigid, it\'s so obvious it has to go- by the way of the dinosaur, except of course to most Japanese people.  It obstructs, hinders, and prevents any meaningful cultural and societal evolution or advancement.  I would have thought that the Japanes would have seen this by now, but i guess  T.V.,  video games, and greed have clouded their judgement.', 'Mr. Paul\'s YouTube video is a despicable exploitation of the suffering of others to gain personally.  Make no mistake, this boy Paul revels in the notoriety and financial gain.  The superficial ""apologies"" he posted are only in reaction to widespread criticism; he would have gladly laughed all the way to the bank had no criticism followed.   The boy clearly has no sense of humanity or compassion.   But the incident will soon be forgotten, I am certain, ""Bro"". What\'s more, he represents the oafish, ignorant and insular person who is so common in the social media.  Do these people interact with others?  Do they understand the human condition?   What do these people really know of others or of the world around them?   For them, life is a collection of moments of cheap entertainment on the Internet, each one quickly forgotten after the next shocking video.   To me, the people who profit from these types of sites are truly the lost and hopeless.     Lastly, one sees hardly a word of the sadness that drove the desperate souls to that cold and lonely place.   May they have found their peace.', 'Yes, as RB stated so well, in all the talk of policy and data there is “hardly a mention” of the sadness that drove those people to that “cold and lonely place.” 30 people in one year is still a lot of people. Perhaps Mr Paul could demonstrate his remorse by joining those foot patrols along the base of Mt Fuji. And then putting a film of his patrol on YouTube. Such sadness, for the individuals and their families. From the article it appears that there are some very dedicated people working to change the outcome. There is always hope.', 'If Mr. Paul is really sorry for his poor judgment, perhaps he could build a chapel or gazebo or some kind of monument to HOPE near the entrance to the forest.']",A commenter questions the validity of the suicide data. Another calls out Logan Paul's lack of morals for a controversial video he filmed at Aokigahara Forest. A commenter explains that suicide should be the focus and not the forest. Another says that the signs do more harm than good. Others question why people would commit suicide in such a beautiful forest.

Of course I am guessing.  There are too many variables to explain these results.', ""Although the author doesn't say it directly, I would say that one of the major factors is culture. Take these people and plop them down into the lives of modern day construction workers in America and I think the results would be different. Also consider how overweight many construction workers are. Look at their meals and most of them go home exhausted. They shower, gorge on an unhealthy dinner accompanied by sodas or beers, and veg out on television. The stress in the US for low income people is also probably a factor. Modern society is very stressful compared to a small and cohesive society in the Amazon. It is not just about activity and food. Feeling part of a closeknit,  traditional society that values family and friendship over television and other modern distractions has to be an important part of the puzzle."", 'You need to consider construction workers diets and what they drink.', ""I am happy that these foaks in Amazon lead a very healthy life.

Read the comment about high rates of cardiovascular disease in the NYT article in this section about weight and heart disease.  Asians have a very high rate of disease despite a native diet that the medical community considers favorable for limiting the accumulation of plaque and subsequent illness.  Other ethnic groups, such as the Masai tribe in Kenya have low rates of disease despite high intake of whole fat diary and meat. Persons of white European descent are somewhere in between - for some, such a diet, along with added sugar foods is deadly while others are hardly affected at all.', 'This is pure bunkum. When Asians were eating their natural high starch diets supplemented with vegetables they had no heart disease just like this population and all the blue zone populations.

The percentages of carbs/fats/proteins varied regionally and seasonally. All of these populations had quite low rates of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity, regardless of whether they were on the high fat or high carb end of the spectrum. What these diets have in common is nutrient density and lack of modern processed foods.', 'As far back as the 1930s, American scientists looked for dietary reasons to explain the higher levels of heart disease and diabetes in Americans compared to people from the Mediterranean.  They found that people eating a true Mediterranean diet ate about 10-15% of their calories from fat, almost a third of what Americans were consuming.  The book, The Blue Zones, published in 2009 discussed the between various ultra-healthy groups of people.  One thing the all  had in common was that they ate a largely plant-based diet, low in fat. I am not sure what is driving the continued debate about the importance of a low fat diet.  The evidence does not seem controversial.  As for inflammation, we need to stop looking at human biochemistry and physiology in a reductionist manner.  It is an intricate, complex set of innumerable chemical reactions.  Too much inflammation is bad, too  little is bad.  You need both omega 3 (inflammation suppression) and omega 6 (inflammation promotion).  There seems to be an ideal ratio of 4 to 1 to 6 to 1 of omega 3 to omega 6.  Again eating an unprocessed, whole grain, low fat, plant-based diet helps one achieve the right balance.', ""The original so-called Mediterranean diet of the famous study was actually the diet of Crete, which is heavy on green and other vegetables (some wild), but certainly not vegan.

I'm curious how many vascular surgeons were available at this military hospital? I just had a long talk about medical management vs PCI of NSTEMIs with a VA internist, and while medical management can have equivalent outcomes for very specific patients, her enthusiasm for it was no doubt influenced by the lack of a vascular surgeon at her hospital. And even when various procedures are available here, there is often a long wait and scheduling difficulties that factor into the decision of whether or not to plan a surgery. Did this study control for differences between the study populations? Were outcomes recorded at all? My fellow commenters seem eager to start pointing fingers at greedy doctors, but in my training I really have yet to see a surgeon or any doctor who didn't truly want what was best for their patients."", 'The pendulum is swinging and for all of the problems with fee for service, the compensation model is moving toward higher pay for providers who spend less money per patient - meaning, they are rewarded for ordering fewer tests and procedures.  That model failed in the 1980\'s with the perception insurance companies had denied approval for appropriate procedures, etc. which ultimately resulted in harm to the patient.  Patients and doctors were really angry with that ""system"" 35 years ago.  People are angry now at what they perceive as a model that doesn\'t give a flip about their health or finances - just wait until they find out their providers are getting paid more for doing even less than they are now !

Who  here would prefer a cane or walker and bottle of ibuprofen as the ""meds and lifestyle modifications"" when they could have their hip or knee surgically replaced- with a 95% good to excellent outcome?

But remember when it finally happens- you\'ll be getting the exact type of healthcare you deserve.', 'Duh!

You should be more careful to attribute that to individual character and avoid stereotypes.  I am quite sure I stand far to the right of your position, but you would find me, and most of the many like me to be more caring, patient centered, cost effective and self-abasing and charitable than many of those I know to the left of me.  I could easily make 50% more than I make now by not making the best choices for my patients.  Neither my patients\' or my geography, race, or gender having any bearing on my choices.

They are not mutually exclusive as you presume.', 'Suprise! From a doctor who practised in both systems - the British National Health Service and the Canadian Fee for Service system.', 'A shocking ""medical heresy"" was quietly stated in a mainstream medical journal.  “Less health care is better than more health care”, says  Dr. Deborah Grady in her editorial in the May 10, 2010 Archives of Internal Medicine which is critical of mainstream medicine.  Dr Grady cites specific examples.   The first is synthetic  hormone therapy used by the mainstream medical system found to cause cancer and heart disease in the 2002 Women\'s Health Initiative study.  Dr. Grady\'s second example is the discredited practice of arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis.  Millions of these useless procedures were performed in the late 90\'s until abandoned after randomized trials showed no benefit.  A third example is the case of SSRI antidepressant drugs offering little benefit for patients with mild to moderate depression.   A fourth example is screening mammography.   ""The adverse effects of mammography—false-positive findings, biopsies, anxiety, and over diagnosis and treatment of latent cancers may overwhelm the benefit."" Dr Grady\'s final example is the over-use and misuse of antacid drugs called proton pump inhibitors (PPI\'s).  When our health care is based on the profit motive, the end result produces more harm than good. Hence, the advice, “Doing Nothing” is frequently the best treatment plan.  for more see:   http://www.bioidenticalhormones101.com/Less_Is_More_Jeffrey_Dach.html jeffrey dach md', ""I couldn't agree more with you. I just moved to the US from Italy where, besides an uncertain economy, health is not privatised.

As an orthopedic surgeon in private practice for 32 years I have seen how technology and a changing medical ethos has allowed surgeons to harvest patients for profit because of the perceived "" better, slicker, cutting edge"" hardware. The findings of this study are not surprising to me at all.', ""In reality, choosing appropriate surgical/procedural candidates is a complex process involving the patient's medical history, co-morbidities, skill level/procedural comfort of the physician, and the patient's wishes.  Of course, the patient's wishes are the most important.  Any idea how many patients opt for non-necessary interventions because they believe more is better and want the most definitive treatment option available?? A LOT.  Many times talking a patient OUT of a procedure, or simple antibiotics, is a real challenge. They are anxious, want something done, and want the problem fixed ASAP.  And for the physician, failure to provide care is a lot harder to defend than overtreatment, so they go along.  Until patients can accept the medicine is an educated guess (bad outcomes will happen) and doing less IS an acceptable treatment option,  the most definitive and thus costly treatment options will dominate."", 'In my training as an orthopaedic surgeon I recall a spine surgery rotation at a prominent  community hospital in the NYC area.   The spine surgeons were excellent.  One day they performed a discectomy on a 16 year old girl with less then six weeks of pain in her leg and a positive MRI for a disc herniation.  I asked why they did not suggest the patient wait longer before having a surgical procedure.  The literature supported that for most patients in her age group with similar medical findings, the symptoms resolve in a few months without long term residual problems. His responded that if he did not do the surgery, someone else in the community would, and he could do a better job. My medical practice was a Kaiser Permanente, where the physicians are salaried and not paid on a case by case basis.  I found there was not financial competition between doctors, allowing for better communication and sharing of patients.  My medical training included rotations all across the country - and I never found a better healthcare delivery system than Kaiser Permanente.', ""Kaiser may be great for members but not for others. By law, COBRA, any hospitals with ERs are required to treat all comers. Twenty-five years ago my wife and I were rear-ended north of LA enroute to La Quinta. My wife with six fused vertebrae experienced severe back pain above the fusion. The closest ER was a Kaiser facility. We stopped and were eventually seen by a Kaiser physician. He essentially gave us the non-members' bums rush refusing to even order an X-ray to look for possible damage from the accident. I offered to pay by credit card or check for the X-ray. No go. Frustrated with not knowing the area and local medical facilities, we drove on to La Quinta. My cousin, a retired ENT, immediately took her to an ER where an X-ray showed a compression fracture above the fusion that led to the terrific Betty Ford clinic and back to Pittsburgh. It's good that Kaiser doctors can communicate well on patient well-being and share patients rather than participate in the medical money scrum. Maybe one day they'll comply with the law and the Hippocratic Oath."", 'Surgery or drugs? The answer is not that simple.  Patients are normally referred by their primary care doctors to surgeons. Of course, initially internists will advise drugs and life style changes to their patients and wait for a period of time but they are not going to take the malpractice risks , it is easy for them to send the patients for surgical evaluation and not being worried about malpractice risk Once patients go to surgeons, what do you expect other than surgery.?', 'We pay TWICE the amount on health care as a percentage of GPD than most of our direct competitors, such as Germany, Japan, Great Britain, etc.  The most important reason is our pay-per-service model (although there are other factors).  Note that our health outcomes are NOT better than these countries, and in many measures are worse. Obamacare did include incentives to move toward s pay-for-performance, but these need to be strengthened. Imagine how the debate over replacing Obamacare would be changed if we could cut costs in half.  Why is the current debate in Congress and in media not about cutting costs???', 'Our health care outcomes are not better than other countries NOT simply because of our health care system but in large part because of our societal problems which are beyond the control of our health care system such as violence, lack of exercise, crime, obesity, smoking, drugs, etc.', ""But you didn't tell us how the patients did. Were surgery outcomes better or worse?"", ""This is oversimplified. For over 20 years I have been getting drug prescriptions to deal with migraines. The drugs were never effective long term. Last year I had surgery to implant a Neuro stimulator. The effect is amazing. I don't know why the surgery was never recommended to me."", ""There is no denying there are physicians corrupted by profit motive but they are a minority and the overall effect on health care spending is not nearly what this report would lead one to believe. Whether the clinical problem is carotid stenosis, coronary artery disease and the use of stents, back pain and choice of surgery or physical therapy, prostate cancer, thyroid nodules, breast calcification on mammograms. Each clinical scenario and each individual patient presents a unique circumstance and clinical decisions are nuanced and influenced by so many factors including insurance coverage as well as patient preference and everything in between. I can't wait until US healthcare finally arrives at it's ultimate destination, a national health system and watch the cultural revolution that will be necessary for patients and their families adapt to the change."", '...and to a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Why is it Docs hate referring to other specialties? Not just profit motive.', 'This is hardly surprising. It is inevitable that some of what drives how healthcare is administered in the U.S. is distorted by the effects of profit motives. You hope that compassion and doing no harm still remain among the biggest drivers of healthcare but the Republican alternative to the ACA and Medicaid drag health care delivery much further away from the laudable goals.', ""When we have a big problem with expanding health care costs, research which points towards saving money in health care delivery ought to receive a lot of attention.  It is unlikely that it will however, since the problems currently being addressed by the debate on health care reform have little to do with saving money and more to do with the rich trying to avoid having to pay more for the country's health care than the middle class or Medicaid population.   Also, what this study misses is that medications and surgery are only 2 options for treatment.  How many doctors opt for none of the above?"", 'This condition is serious and requires treatment. None of the above?

It's important to look at how Zines still offer a deeper study than the internet. As they (I) say, the web is wide and shallow while zines (and books) are narrow and deep. Zines have a particular importance in architecture and design culture, where new ideas and speculative thinking have been done for a while (since the 70s at least) while design on the internet usually involves generic coverage from ignorant, non-expert critics who don't really have interest in the subjects. Zines are usually written by experts with a deeper level of love."", 'Without small press journals, even going back to the 1920s, most American poets would never have made it to print -- and most are literary. This continues to be the case. Though internet sites,"" e-zines,"" are cheaper to produce, the quality of attention and reading are very different. They call it virtual for a reason. An actual, paper in your hand publication, requires not only more commitment on the parts of both producer and reader, it requires more focus than browsing a screen. The average website visit can be measured in seconds and is usually under 2 minutes. In a book one reads and considers, then turns the page. Arrangement and presentation matter more as well. Actual journals in print are also more permanent with lives of their own. They are saved or passed around, need no internet connection or batteries, they continue to be read for years. The internet and the language of programs are passing fancies dependent on particular conditions and limited in access unlike books and journals in which our words will outlive us.', ""So, in other words, zines thrive because, unlike the Internet, they are relatively troll-proof. That's reason enough for me."", 'Thanx to the previously posted comments for reminding me what a zine once was. Greedsters killed the World Wide Web. Starting with Microsoft who killed Netscape.

Social media sites tie into your real life identity so users don't want to discuss anything that could be controversial or come back to haunt them. Social media sites thread and display ongoing discussions very poorly. Online communities were much more vibrant and interesting being based on interests and hobbies, and not our material networked identity. Why would I want to communicate with the same social network online as I already do in real life? Boring! I want to meet new people based on my interests and hobbies, and far away from my existing social networks.  Also cookie cutter web design and dull user experience of social media sites and WordPress killed communicative creativity and innovation. Flash sites may not have always been pretty but some people did some really creative designs and experiences through a website using Flash. Now it's the same HTML5  template over and over again.

I myself began pubbing my ish (more fannish lingo, which I'm sure you can understand by context) in the late 1960s. Some fanzines were crude things, produced on hectos (hectographs), dittos (spirit duplicator), or mimeos (mimeographs), while the more serious among us sometimes went for a more professional look with printing presses and Xerography. Ray Bradbury and Roger Ebert, among many others, pubbed fanzines.

I mention this to say that it was readily apparent that ""print guys""more or less hated television. Back when radio and television were new, newspapers made efforts to try to lock them out of news sources and events, including refusing  admission to the press galleries in Congress, the work areas for reporters. Eventually, comprises were reached and print came to tolerate, while still loathing, broadcasters. The threat was real. The shrinking of newspapers down to one per city is directly due to television taking away ad dollars and to the rise of the evening newscasts.

The Brits have already done this work and published new guidelines for Asians. However, the real problem is the improper use of the BMI as an individual metric.  There is too much variability in the relationship between risk factors and BMI to be usefully applied to individuals. This is well documented but for reasons I don’t understand, the medical community still misapplies a population metric to evaluate samples (i.e. patients).  And lastly, why is the medical community still looking at BMI when science-based evidence demonstrates that it is abdominal obesity and not overall weight that is the problem.', 'Personally, I have found that my numbers are influenced by my diet and not my weight.', '""Normal weight"" is a definition that has changed over the years.

He has been warning for many years that small and dense LDLs made from carbs (plus protein) are major cause of heart attack and stroke. Recently his theory is accepted by the large number of researchers. Asians, Hispanics and African-Americans tend to eat lots of carbs, and this is the reason why a large number of them suffer from metabolic syndrome such as high level of cholesterol (LDL-C), high-blood pressure, diabetes, fatty liver etc. Dr. Michael Murray, a leading diabetes physician, mentions that many thin persons with high level of cholesterol (LDL-C) also suffers from diabetes or pre-diabetes because most of them have low level of AMPK, an enzyme that facilitates glucose uptake for the energy production by mitochondria. He recommends cutback of carbs intake for those people (toward healthy fat intake).', '""small and dense LDLs made from carbs (plus protein) are major cause of heart attack and stroke"" Lipoproteins are comprised of fats and proteins (hence the name).

BMI is a poor predictor for South Asians  who often show a “thin-fat” syndrome where they fall within BMI standards but have more visceral fat—abdominal fat that is more likely to lead to a cardiovascular event. Waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio may be more predictive measurements for this group, More than one third of South Asian men and 17 percent of South Asian women have metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

Small LDL particles,are more atherogenic than larger particles.', 'My physician told me that the feast or famine physique (by ancestral life conditions, not current life circumstances), among South Asians is to blame for hypersensitivity to sugar.

More than the actual LDL numbers in milligrams/deciliter, the ratio of total cholesterol, LDL + HDL + VLDL, to HDL is considered by many physicians to be a good measure of proclivity to heart attacks. This ratio in South Asians tend to be large, as large as 5 as opposed to the ``ideal'' number of 3 or less. It is difficult to raise the HDL number to the desired number 40 mg/dl. Diabetes in South Asians is perhaps not genetic but due to sudden change in lifestyle at all levels.

You missed the point because no one claimed Greece situation is an apples-to-apples situation - of course it is not. The point is, which I find surprising that you did not understand is, Greece has no financial control tools to fight their debt crises. Of course Greece faked accounts to get into the Euro, etc etc - that is not the point. After the financial crises - Greece had pretty little tools in their arsenal to fight the crises & that is directly because they used the Euro and are in the EU.  To give you an example of a few; Greece cannot devalue the currency they use, since they use Euro. Greece could not also lower interest rates or use negative rates, since interest rates in the Euro area is set by the ECB. Are there are all sorts of capital controls, financial instruments available to Iceland that was simple not a choice for Greece. Financial instruments like currency swaps or options/futures on currency swaps or instruments - again, to name a few. They simply could not do all of that because they have no control of interest rates, currencies & others - So, very surprised you can come out here & ignore the constraints of being in the EU & in the Eurozone.

The President, the Treasury, Congress, the Justice department and the Federal Reserve did everything in their power to ensure that there would be no accountability, financial or legal, for any crimes committed. All bad bets were paid off by ordinary taxpayers. Consequently, the banks got bigger, the gap between rich and poor got dramatically wider, economic pain in key midwestern states lingered while faith in the federal government and in the rule of law reached an all-time low.

And so it has been with the Department of Veterans Affairs.","['As the author in the early 1980s of a chapter in a book, ""Computers in Critical Care and Pulmonary Medicine"" I referred to the VA system as  a positive example of how best to deploy computers in medical care.  Now, as a patient receiving much of my care at the VA Medical Center in Martinsburg, WV, I continue to see more positives than negatives in the system. My appointments take place when scheduled;  my physicians spend time listening thinking issues through and in many cases have provided better outcomes than those I see outside the VA;  my complete medical record is available at each visit (because of this several prescriptions have been changed due to potential interactions).  ""My Health Vet"" allows me to communicate with my providers and I have never failed to receive a prompt and meaningful response. Yes. the facility is shabby, half the elevators are out of service at any given time, the waiting room TVs don\'t always work and wall clocks sometimes show the wrong time but I consider this a good trade-off for the courtesy and competence of the staff. My prescriptions easily renewed on line and are sent directly to my home. I suspect and fear that much of the criticism aimed at the VA comes from individuals and groups whose purpose is to starve a working system in order to privatize veterans\' medical care for personal gain.', 'I have found the opposite to be true for my 16 year experience with the VA EHR and appointment & pharmacuetical systems.  My Medical records once occupying several regional ocations due to my travels have become accessable at my present location.  The appointment system has changed several times, but generally for the better and under my control locally, as has the pharmacy refill systems.  This has occurred for the most part within the last 4 years.', ""I have been in VA Health Care System since 2009 when President Obama reversed the policy of excluding Priority Group 8 veterans after the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq. My health care is centered at the James A. Haley Tampa VA Hospital. I am a Vietnam-era Navy veteran. I consider the care I have gotten to be first class and the best health care I have ever had.  I have found the system to be efficient and the employees on all levels to be genuinely interested in the health of the veterans. In addition I have found my own doctor and all staff to be caring and truly concerned about my health. The staff, in fact, always thanks me for my service....something few non-veterans have ever expressed to me.  I have been lucky that at 67, I have no serious health issues, but all I can say is that I strongly support the VA and do not, under any circumstances, want it to be privatized. I realize that there are serious issues, as would be found in any organization so large...but for me I am very pleased with the service I have received."", ""The failures of the VA to uphold it's essential mission: taking care of those men and women who served their country mirror the current state of public education. Everyone in politics claim to have the best interests of children and vets in mind and then prove through their deeds that it is really lobbyists they serve. The sad part is the people making do with so little to do so much, (doctors, nurses, therapists, social workers, teachers, etc) KNOW exactly how to fix the problems that these important institutions face. Sadly the Democratic Party will pay lip service and wring their hands helplessly, and the Republican Party will continue to chip away at the few remaining resources that exist and try to privatize the rest."", ""I was involved in the computerization of the New York Metropolitan Area VA's when the VA had the most innovative medical record and scheduling system in health care, bar none. Interns and residents were agog at the power of the system, which allowed clinicians tho see medical records on patients going back years and across the country and even the sea; there was simply nothing like it in the private sector. Then the money to keep the system at the cutting edge dried up. The system started to wither, until it became a clunky legacy. The VA always gets a bad rap for what ultimately is its core problem: IT IS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT CONTROL. Yes, if the VA operated like a private sector entity the once-proud array of computer programs would be up-to-date and still in the forefront. But in so much of the VA, political interests overcome health care interests and the system suffers."", 'Almost didn’t read this as I mis-interpreted “Designs” in the title thinking it was a political attack on the V.A., without any solutions. But as Arieff is your best occasional columnist, the author brought me to it. She always has important and unique insights. Here, she’s good but not at her best. She delivers that rare, well-thought out solution to inefficiencies there. She avoids some minefields: technology-centric innovation is sufficient, showing it can be complimented by listening; and government could benefit from some business processes without blind “advocacy for privatization.” It reminded me I recently wrote a similar article: “America’s Broken Systems: A Case for Sustainable Design,”  http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/organizational_change/ma... . But she misses a few: (a) Innovation Fellows are nearly exclusively technology-centric. If Trump even keeps them, there doesn’t seem to be a place in their “ecosystem” for non-technology innovation; (b) she invokes conventional wisdoms without her usual questioning, that bigger institutions are more dysfunctional, and measurement is a panacea, without its own issues; (c) some private sector practices should never be replicated (e.g. bad customer service exists there, too; and (d) people don’t necessarily know what they want. Still, it’s valuable to see actual improvements to government processes instead of mindless calls for agency elimination.', ""What a heartening story. I never thought about actual  design principles in relation to websites.

Real and regular people coming together to get things done, using all the tools available to them, private and public. People on a mission to improve not only the systems of government and its agencies, but the people - the citizens- they directly impact. Which when fixed impacts us all. When a veteran can get their necessary services and needs met, that imparts immeasurable amounts of added value to the nation in general. When a vet can overcome their injuries(seen or unseen) and get back into society to contribute - its win-win for everyone!  Tangent. So maybe to avoid this; ""A caveat here: Helping governmental agencies treat their constituents like customers they hope to retain should in no way be translated as advocacy for the privatization of those functions (as seems to be the desire of the current administration)"" We need to not describe citizens as customers, or clients - but rather what they truly are - Owners! Our elected employees need to remember that they dont own the country, we all do. They are but employees - and not even board members - just simple public servants.   So a veteran should be described, and wholly viewed, as an Owner-veteran, not a customer/client of services provided by the VA. Someone seeking to register a car should be viewed as a Owner-citizen/driver, not just another customer in the way of a DMV employee\'s next break.', 'Now, if they can just keep Voldemort from ruining it all. My husband is a veteran, Navy. His work on the ship was in the ""shaft alley"". It was a ship designated an experimental ship, which meant that every piece of hardware that was ready to be tried on a real ship, ended up on this one. As usual, most of the things didn\'t work in the real world. Some did. But, those who worked in the shaft alley worked in a very noisy environment. Supposedly they were supposed to wear ear protection, but, not enough were provided, so often a sailor didn\'t have any. Also, the regulations stated that no sailor over 6\' tall could be assigned to the shaft alley. At the time he was over 6\' tall. Now he is 65, deaf in one ear (using an \'as seen on TV\' ""aid""). His back is permenantly curved. But, he has no problems. So says the VA. He is on medicare now, so all we need is the 20% of the hearing aid that the Medicare HMO doesn\'t cover. Should be a simple thing right? Save the gov some money. Nope. His back isn\'t fixable. So he will just keep getting shorter, looking lower, till he dies.

The purpose of the visit was to assist my aunt's brother in his effort obtain veteran's benefits.  The brother had served in the Army during WWII in Europe, from Normandy to VE day.  His claim was stuck in the bureaucracy. In hindsight, it seems to me that the VA served two functions.  The first was to provide benefits for veterans.  The second was to ration benefits for veterans.  The conflicting roles arose out of the appropriations process.  Congress could not be seen as writing a blank check to the VA.  That was as true during the Eisenhower administration in every subsequent administration.  The easiest and safest way to ration veterans benefits was to stifle claims in a bureaucratic quagmire.  Elected officials could excuse their callousness by the VA. I'm pleased to see that steps are being taken to streamline the bureaucracy, but I wonder whether those steps will be sufficient to resolve the issue of rationing benefits."", 'Congratulations to the VA for bringing humanity into its work.

A Navy acquaintance of mine has applied for disability compensation on that basis.  Now he happens to be grossly overweight and I suspect his dietary habits are a more likely source of his diabetes than any unconfirmed, brief exposure to agent orange.

While I had to wait a couple of days, I did get to see the doctor, got a comprehensive exam, got a cane and some time with a physical therapist, and yes, some pain pills. My doctor even took the time to walk me to where I needed to go, which was appreciated as we in Eugene Oregon have a new clinic. I felt cared for and most importantly, got the care that eventually got my back to health.

]","Laura Osnes and Corey Cott star in a new Broadway musical, set in 1945, about a musician, a singer, trauma and healing.","[""As an acting instructor and production coordinator at Hastings High School, I understand, like many theater goers, that we will not all agree on what is great musical theater, or successful musical theater. Today, my 10 year old daughter and I waited at the stage door after the performance to thank the cast as a few (not enough!) came out. We have felt moved to do this often after a show, but actually waited only twice before: after Fun Home, and Dear Evan Hansen. This reviewer missed something essential about this show. The connection of the extraordinary band, dancers, and actors with the audience was palpable. Even if you have all kinds of logistical problems with the show, you fail to see that the experience of theater has its own logic beyond journalism.  Again, we don't have to agree...but I felt this show created its own extraordinary theatrical language and reality. I wish I could bring my acting class in the fall. But it won't be around. The reviewer is a good writer, no doubt. I hope to use this review in my class to show how good writing has little to do with the actual magic of theater."", ""That's a pity that you didn't get to meet more of the cast at stage door. By all accounts on the BWW message board, this young cast comes out pretty promptly and is very friendly, willing to sign, take photos or just chat."", 'I am so disappointed as my mother and I were so looking forward to seeing Bandstand.  Now that this show has been cancelled, how long will it take the producer to notify all ticketing agencies that all shows after September 17th have been cancelled.  Unfortunatelly, I hold two tickets for a performance on September 20th purchased through  Broadway.com   This ticketing agency will not refund until notification from director. AMEX will not refumd or send an inquiry until the date of the event has passed.   Suggestions for another good show to see while in NYC?', 'Now that the show has announced it\'s closing noticed -- for September 17th -- this bizarre review (egregiously quoted in today\'s announcement, to make sure we understand the Times never endorsed the piece) is worth re-examining.  It\'s so full of contradictory half-baked appraisals, so utterly dismissive of the creators\' clear strategy: to deconstruct the tropes of the MGM musical, to fine new nuances and excavate psychological truths beneath time-worn cliches.  ""Bandstand"" remints the very components it examines, purposely and purposefully. It\'s startling that the critic didn\'t even consider the show\'s use of the traditional post-war romance to re-explore classic themes and story constructs.  We get it, most of us, the eight times a week the show performs. But this reviewer is determined to disregard the show\'s ambitions and execution.  Now that ""Bandstand"" is about to fold, it\'s just sad.  When I saw it, the wet-eyed audience cheered it mightily, the men in line at the restroom at intermission so moved they could not speak.  That doesn\'t happen much, but it\'s decidedly attributable to this show\'s craft, artistry, and heart.', 'I didn\'t get this review either. The critic\'s main problem appears to be that the show is senselessly pulling in opposite directions. On the one hand it is exposing the mental trauma of the returned soldiers caused by what they had witnessed and done, while at the same time it keeps inserting upbeat songs and dances. She doesn\'t see that the show is telling us that the mental distress can be and largely was overcome through the healing power of music and friendship. Perhaps Bandstand didn\'t do a good job of making this clear to someone who went into the theater cold with no knowledge of the show.  I was puzzled by the closing assertion that the audience reacted with indifference to Bandstand, without emotion. The two times that I saw it, there were plenty of tears, including some of mine, and a great roar greeted the climactic ""Welcome Home"". Perhaps your critic saw Bandstand in a private showing, or maybe the cast had not yet learned how to deliver the', '""If “Bandstand” really worked, the finale would find you laughing and crying. Instead, you might just make like the dancers and shrug."" I can\'t fault Ms. Soloski for setting forth this requirement that Bandstand had to meet to be labeled a success. Perhaps her audience shrugged. The two times that I saw the new musical, however, the audience completely bought into the second act with its tears and with its grins. The reviewer was very wrong in stating that that act was a showcase for a ""let\'s put on a show"" jollity. Putting together this band of World War II combat veterans suffering from what we learned to call after Vietnam ""post-traumatic stress disorder,"" was a hard sell and keeping the band together through real and threatened walkouts and no-shows was a very close matter. Ultimately the audience embraces other members of the band besides leader Danny and vocalist war widow Julia. The burly alcoholic Irish bass player with the good one-liners and the drummer who had flipped his jeep three times on the way to a broken back were favorites. If there was still any question of whether the audience was with the performers, it is brushed aside when the end of the climactic song performed by the band, ""Welcome Home"" is greeted by a great roar that continues for half a minute. If you were attracted to this show by the fine swing score or by its subject, go see it and discover the reaction of your audience. Tickets are certainly plentiful and cheap.', 'Undercooked to say the least - poor direction, script and story line, timing, theater in bad shape (delay start of 2nd), music off -maybe it was supposed to be so the finale would save the show - even the jokes went flat - worst we have ever seen!  Even Laura (who was great - could not save it). Tonys Seriously?', 'I was so dismayed by the lack of diversity in the cast. It\'s bad enough for older shows, but I think it is unconscionable to cast a ""new American musical"" almost completely devoid of people of color.', ""For a show that's supposed to be about a winning song, the music is utterly forgettable. Great dancing though."", 'It does have the best music of any new musical that premiered on Broadway this season, which says more about the awful music in the other shows than the decent music in this show.', ""In a generally depressing Broadway season, BANDSTAND stands out as risky, creative and moving--and with a score that isn't the same, forgettable belting that has dominated shows in recent years. It was a little long, but dared to deal with real human emotions and conflicts. And the singing and dancing were plenty entertaining to boot. A good show about those who gave us the best years of their lives."", 'Why is the design team not listed in the credits section at the bottom of this article? The team is: Scenic Design by David Korins Costume Design by Paloma Young Lighting Design by Jeff Croiter Sound Design by Nevin Steinberg Hair and Wig Design by J. Jared Janas and Dave Bova Makeup Design by J. Jared Janas and Dave Bova', 'I really can\'t wait for a talented, experienced critic like Jesse Green to come aboard so we don\'t have to slog through ridiculous ""criticism"" such as this. The show is not ""undercooked"", but I get the feeling the critic may be. What a shame the Times sent out a third stringer to review a musical that should have been the domain of a first stringer. Thanks to you, Alexis, so many, many people will choose not to see an electrifying piece of theatre.', ""It's ridiculous to criticize Alexis Soloski for writing what most every other major critic is writing about Bandstand: that it's nothing spectacular, save the choreography. Reading all of the major reviews will reveal the same theme - though some couch it more kindly than others.  The consensus is that the choreography is magnificent and the main reason to see this piece; the direction and much of the acting is also excellent. Yet that consensus notes that the book is half-baked from their view and the music and lyrics - though performed expertly - lean more to the mundane than the intriguing or memorable.  It's clear the critics believe Blankenbuehler has a great musical or two to direct in the future - but that Bandstand, in its current incarnation, is not that musical. Criticize Soloski if you wish but her review is in line with most of the alleged first-stringers - so why not question their credentials as well? Jesse Green's review was indeed somewhat more positive than most others, yet it was a display of dancing in circles around Bandstand itself - reviewing a past era as an entity more than reviewing the piece before him. The upcoming Tony nominations will tell the tale. Expect a few nods for Bandstand - but not as many as predicted before its debut."", 'It\'s a pity that an original musical such as this, full of joyous dance and music of the swing era, juxtaposed with mourning for those who never made it back physically or mentally, will have a hard time maintaining a long run. Reviews ran from fair to rave. Some reviewers seemed to think that it was a deadly mistake to mix fun and enthusiasm for the music and dance with the seldom seen stories of those returning do damaged from the unimaginable horrors of all out war. “Bandstand” is an undercooked slice of apple pie, served with a dollop of anguish."" How long did it take Alexis to craft that line? Bandstand was very true to life. The survivors come home joyful for their survival and ready to pick up their lives again. The dead are mourned. And both occur simultaneously.', 'It\'s a good point. The situation of the returning vets was not pretty  and there were problems in readjustment to ""normal"" life. Most men I know who went through WWII (and my father was one) couldn\'t talk about it. However, except for the ""Welcome Home"" number, most of this musical is derivative. I\'ve seen it a thousand times. The plaintive situation, the boy/girl angle, those eleven o\'clock numbers with the high voices and the reaching arms (at 3, 6, 8, 10, and 11 o\'clock), and the dancers\' out of the time period dancing that was neither stylish nor lyrical - but most audiences couldn\'t tell good dancing anyway, Broadway has so diminished the art lately. A good idea that capsizes underneath what passes for Broadway show biz. Too much stuff in the stew.Too bad.', ""I’m not so sure it will have too hard a time maintaining a long run.  It's certainly not the sort of thing a Times critic would like (much less the New Yorker, whose criticism seemed largely political), but the crowd loved it yesterday, myself among them.  There are certainly flaws, especially the plodding scansion of the lyrics; if you're doing a classic musical set in the 40's, you're getting into the ring with Mr Hammerstein.  Verbal standards are a lot higher than for modern-day mega-musicals, and I fear no-one born after Sondheim will be up to the challenge.  (I suspect my generation and later weren't exposed to scanning verse in elementary school and will never surmount that…)"", ""Haven't seen the show. I know no one involved in this show. But this review was one of the most contradictory ridiculous pieces of writing I've ever encountered. On one hand it's not dark enough on the other hand it's too dark on one hand the lighting is sepulchral  on the other it's too bright… Not enough focus on the gloomy aspects… Trying to put on a fun show…  most compelling is that it's an ORIGINAL musical. No mention of that. Silly critic.  Gloomy critic. Shrug."", 'I saw ""Bandstand"" a few nights before opening, and was impressed by how well it balanced the important, weighty topics surrounding veterans\' health issues with the lighthearted fun that we expect from blockbuster musical. The music is great, the dancing is fun, the performers are - to a person - intensely talented, the design is stunning, and the story is just as relevant and fresh now as it was 70 years ago.  If you\'re a New York Times critic its your job to scratch 10 layers below the surface and find fault in all sorts of ways. That\'s cool. But as an audience member, my review would simply have been: ""This is a fun, energetic show with a resounding message."" Go see ""Bandstand,"" you\'ll have a great time.', 'This was a good idea than just went flat. Got the feeling all the characters (exception of the mother) were just trying to get through the play. Enthusiasm of the main character came through wooden. As much as it is a selling point, people who worked or were associated with Hamilton does not ensure a hit! Bandstand is just one example.', 'Too bad, shows featuring real instruments on stage played by real musicians featuring classic American music are rare enough. Rap is diverting for a moment on Broadway but Jazz has the depth to show us who we are as Americans and where we come from as a people.', ""And while we're rightfully worrying about the lack of diversity in casting and story telling, might the Times consider retiring the term brunette (and blonde for that matter), that sexist chestnut when used as a noun. It diminishes women to hair color, the reason it's rarely used to describe men. Sure, it's in the spirit of 1946, but not 2017."", 'I don\'t think that you saw the same play I saw.  \'Bandstand\' is very much in touch with today\'s zeitgeist--while about a war that was not just part of the ""all war all the time"" era we live in now.  It is the Voice, and it is PTSD, and it is charm and spectacle.  It even is about heroes who are aware enough to note that maybe they aren\'t heroes--just someone to pin that label on.  The whole evening was invigorating, fun and tearful.  And Corey Cott is amazing.']","Some commenters praise the uniqueness and realism of the show in a moving way. A few of them simply criticize the critics. Others complain about lousy acting and music.

Stick to VPN apps that have a clear no-log policy.  I would also recommend to have a back up VPN if you are staying in China for longer periods of time -- or at least a way to download a spare app. VPN services are sporadically targeted by the Great Firewall and can become unusable at times.

I thought that a conversation with a the chef in a local restaurant in his native language would get me an authentic curry, but American Thai curries are as sweet as desserts.

Associating the death of the first born to the horror visited upon the Syrian people confuses me.  The powers that be do not suffer this plague.

So my Christian friends from that area bemoan the pursuit of democracy at the cost of the safety of their families. Instead of plagues, perhaps we should spend more time thinking about the modern forms of human bondage and focus our wrath on the inequalities that put people on the street and trafficks in sexual and labor slavery.  We might consider the bondage of ideologies that threaten to leave millions more Americans without healthcare and make the bonds between plutocrats stronger than compassion for those without wealth or work to earn a living.

The color of most athletes' skin contributed to this feeling. While I realize the athletes who submit to this treatment have big, life enhancing paychecks in mind, the parallels are disturbing. Thanks to Powell for describing in gruesome detail the rest of the story."", ""There are a minority of players who chose to skip the scouting combine and the NFL Draft party, and still play in the league.   A player has more volition than this article presents. If you have excelled at the college level, you may simply have the NFL scouts and coaches come to your school on a pro day, and go through some rudimentary drills like the 40 yard dash.  No colonoscopy required.   Almost every Division l university has a pro day.   Then on draft day you may wait for your phone to ring wherever you wish to be. It's a risk.   You may not get as much money if you are not selected on the first or second day of the draft.   However, it's not as big a risk now as draft picks have their money limited by the latest collective bargaining agreement.   The really big money comes in free agency after the initial contract.   (Ironically, it is sometimes better for a player not to be drafted in the late rounds, because as a free agent competing teams bid up the money for the player's services.) These guys go to the scouting combine on their own free will.   Is it a bit impersonal?   Yeah.   But they want to enhance their chances of making it as  a professional. I would say the exploitation of players at the college level by coaches and athletic directors receiving millions is a much bigger scandal."", ""Football has a free training system of junior leagues, high schools and colleges. The NFL has failed to protect players from deadly head injury and it is well documented that they even employed shill medical professionals to attempt to discredit Doctors who discovered chronic traumatic encephalitis of the brain and its causes. From early on these boys and men are used solely for their athletic potential and prowess. As quickly as that ability fades or crashes, the NFL and colleges jettison them.  There is no doubt that they are treated as commodities and that the NFL shows no common decency or humanity in treating them as such.  Attend a stock trading show and you will see so many parallels to the 'combine' that it will sicken you. The NFL represents the worst instincts of our society and of business interest in the way it conducts it's business with players. And other sports are following suit.  As it trickles down to youth soccer programs, little league baseball and many other activities, it infects a society with a joy draining manic push for generations of young people.  If you watch the NFL, pay for the swag and promote it with your interest, you are part of the problem."", ""Stupid article. No one is forced to play pro football. All the the screening is vital to the organizations that are about to commit 10s of millions of dollars that can't be taken back as sign up bonuses and guaranteed payments to 22ish, high T young men who may or may not actually make their team, be quickly injured and unable to perform, or just lose all motivation when becoming overnight multi millionaires. Given that environment the teams try to cover their bets as best they can. The measurements and tests are agreed to by all and enthusiastically undertaken by the candidates who are potentially set up financially for life by the results. They celebrate the results! Criticize football for violence, potential permanent damage to participants, twisted values, whatever, but get off the politically correct, rights angle."", 'Great article, poor conclusion.  That the cynic sees these young men as modern day gladiators, primed by their teams to prepare for the Sunday at the coliseum in front of the mob is not that far from reality, with the disclosure that head injuries are a byproduct of the NFL. Five years ago, watching college football, it dawned on me that the epidemic of piling on by the defense was rampant, and had to lead to more running back injuries that necessary to have a real football game.  Now we have a state of denial by all things football, but the league is worth $50 billion dollars and owned by essentially 32 partners.  Television has aided and abetted all of this, making more billions from the gladiators on the field.', 'This story should be told, but is anyone surprised in the least?

The author should be sacked for taking this tone in his article."", 'Shame on the media for the coverage of this manufactured event (I am not referring to this article).

Better to devote the ink to baseball.', ""If it's degrading to the players, then they don't have to do it.

On of the stories that really impressed me is that, when the author talks about single mother Natalie Davis. She actually sacrifices all of her life only for her children. I don't think it's easy to work less and handle the whole family budget as a single mother,but she show us. Even\u200b thought money is important to fulfill our desire but family time is more important then that. For me I think we all should balance our time for work and family. Also we should choose the work we like the most not the work that only fulfill our unnecessary demand."", 'Money is a peculiar thing that life seems to be focused around. Everyone wants to earn money because it drives the world. Without making money it is difficult to live well. People need money to buy things to fulfill both necessity and desirable. People have many ways of making money but it depends on what way they choose to earn that money. They make money to live a better and secure life in the future. For that reason, people ignore their family sometimes. To me family is more important than making money. I think it’s not right to earn money while ignoring one’s family. On the other hand, it is essential to save money for future life security. When people make more money than they need, they spend money on unnecessary things. In my opinion, people should be more careful on how they spend their money. People should be more attentive towards their family than making money.', 'In our society money has a great value for our lives. We all worry about saving money for our future, and one way in which I save money day by day is by buying only the necessary things that I will use in a week. I prepare food at home every day. I do not have cable service. I watch movies in Netflix.  I believe that we should think about our future and save money for an emergency. But we should not forget to enjoy our present lives with our families, because money is very important but it does not give us happiness.', 'Money is important in every step of life. Now a day’s people run after earning money. Moreover, most of family both parents go to job for earning money. They do not have much time to give their children, relative, friends. Sometime we see they are not affectionate with their children. Most of time people get affected to many things and they buy it though it is unnecessary. Obviously money is important but we should not give up our family, children, relatives because of money. In my opinion we should always remember Happiness, love, affection is more important than money', 'I believe when we are consistently making money we are not investing enough time with our children. When both parents go to make money we do not have time to spend with our children. We need money to survive, but we need to take the money and manage it by cutting unwanted spending and use it to make time with our kids. I cut all unwanted spending and do not use it to further my education because of my children. I want to stay with them, make sure they are healthy, help them with their homework and make sure they focus on their school work. I know, some parents go to work to make money for their future but after doing so, that parent does not have money and nor does their children. By spending so much time working, when it is time for them to actually spend time with their kids, it is too late because they no longer want to spend their time with their parents. They instead spend time with their friends or anyone else except their parents and their excuse is that since their parents weren’t there when they were younger or when they needed them, they no longer feel it is necessary now. To me investing time with my kids is like investing money in the future.', ""Some of the choices I make about money on a daily basis is when I'm grocery shopping, or buying new clothes or spending leftover money from bills to buy extra things. Sometimes I have to buy things that are more useful and helpful in my life, so I need to save money from buying extra clothes for example. Sometimes my children want to eat a lot of different stuff but I can't buy all of them at the same time, so I buy one or two and buy more next time I get my paycheck. These are the kind of things I trade of when deciding whats necessary right now and what can be bought later on or what isn't really useful. I can't always have everything I want, and sometimes my children are young so they don't understand, so they ask for a lot of stuff, so I trade-off what I want in order to buy the things my children want or need."", 'In my opinion, we should do work hard for a better future.

Every day, in the evening  you need e little time to think about  tomorrow, and at the end of the day you will be able to calculate the result of your day about what you did and how much money its cost. In my opinion, one of the best ways to make money every day is to have a daily schedule about your life, avoid going to the stores frequently. Avoid going to much to the expensive restaurant just to save money, and buy exactly what you need. Another one is to be focus by thinking about your study or your work. More you think about your work and your study; most you improve your skills and become better for making money every day.', 'In term of money, there are many factors that contribute in people economic. Some of them are related on how many jobs do they have or their average of income they earn, it could be also the amount of expenses under their responsibilities. Another factor that contributes in putting people into financial problem is lack of financial education. For instance, we can mention three categories of income level in society where people may fall; these are low, middle and high income. One family composed of three members, with a yearly income of $15,000 dollars, is considered a low income family, and has more limited options to supply it needs. In my personal case, I use the practice of income and expenses, that way, I realize on how I will spend money every day. I recommend people to be more educated in term of their financial level and be more careful on how they spend their money.', 'In my opinion I make decisions to save and not spend unnecessary money, I take a list of the things I need most and I see the budget of what I have to spend or save myself every day. I make my decisions for good for me, because if you do not save or you do not know how or what to spend your money you will never have anything that can get you out of debt. I make the decisions that I have to make.

I am very careful at the time of making unnecessary expenses and I think that if I am very good at handling money, modesty aside that my husband likes very much the way I take care of the savings we make. On the other hand I think it is very good to save and be careful with the handling of money, but also I think that not everything is money and from time to time it is good to enjoy that money to do simple but important things such as travel in Family and get out of the rut from time to time.

Troops crushed an uprising against Chinese rule in 1959, when the Dalai Lama fled into exile in India. What Chinese rule in 1959?  China invaded Tibet and there was no provocation by Tibet, nor did Tibet ever invade or take any territory from China.

I have complete faith in the 14th Dalai Lama that he will lead his people out of chains and shackles from the oppressor regime(s of China.  I too look forward to meeting the Dalai Lama and just a simple nod from him or body language or the holiness looking straight in my eye will be the blessing that I seem to want so much.

When the 14th Dalai Lama passes away China will launch a campaign to impress that they have found the child to be the Dalai Lama.

Going with the flow is surely comforting, like wanting to remain floating, suspended in the security of our mothers womb. But  to borrow a phrase, we must be born again to truly fulfill the human potential in each of us. But for me that means not living our short precious lives through someone else's eyes, nor with their pre-packaged answers and choices, nor by  following their “sacred” commands. It means believing in ourselves instead of them.  It means living our lives instead of theirs. It means standing up - against the flow - like the proud Men and Women that we truly are, and choosing to live our own lives on our own paths. with our own meanings and mistakes and methods.

As per usual, this play depicts sibling rivalry and inheritance issues. The family wasn't particularly religious, but they did seem to have inherent Jewish feelings and identity.

The sadness of adolescent mental illness was a theme of significance and the emotional response of the young cousin to his ""only cousin\'s"" illness was touching and poignant. The relationships of the three siblings were complex and meaningful and their varying responses to Judaism made for an interesting intersection of opinions.

Actually, Boochani may owe his life to Australian policy. His first boat sank and then the authorities found the second one which had been lost at sea for a week. Just letting everyone in who comes is not the right solution for many reasons. Let\'s hope Australia can improve on the current treatment and that Boochani soon finds a place to live.

Do we think they would really be tossed aside if they went public in their criticism? Times standards supposedly say ""We resist granting anonymity for opinion, speculation or personal attacks.""

The Times seems blissfully unaware that it can set the parameters for ads in its own digital space.

My brother has done that for 40 years at the Baltimore Sun, and I guarantee he would have caught the mistake. Let\'s go back to Spayd\'s column of early February about the coming brave new world of Times editing, and how many fewer eyes will sçan a story.

In the short film, ""An impossible choice"" records history of the rescue mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The united states government could not help every refugee escape to safety. So instead they approved for 112  refugees on the list to be helped. I found this to be so tragic, thousands of good people trapped and begging for help to save them, wishing someone could save them. Then two people, come saying their here to save only 112 refugees on the list. Who decide whether someone lives or dies? Last time I check we all shed the same blood no one on this earth has the right to decide if someone lives or dies. I find this video to be inspiring that Sheikha Ali knew the risk of add more than 112 refugees but still added them, that took real guts. Meanwhile i was every suprise with how Sasha Chanoff a man who seems to go by the book actually decided to break the rules knowing the risk that may come behind it. However I still don\'t believe they had the right to decide this major decision. For this is life or death, if they don\'t get on the plane who knows how long they may lie in those conditions. I feel very strongly on this subject because no needs to live like the Democratic Republican are living. So again I ask who gets to decide whether people live or dies? What gives them the right to decipher this huge decision?', 'The Tutsi are a people of the Democratic Republic of Congo who are being persecuted by their own government who is basically committing genocide. This documentary is sad because two humanitarians, Sasha Chanoff and Sheikha Ali, comes to Congo to rescue 112 people and put them on the last flight out of the republic but while there they encountered mothers and children who are malnourished and are in need of desperate help. The impossible decision to make between saving the 112 or taking the women and children ultimately came down to the women and children which i think touched but saddened many of out hearts. What stood out to me was while Sheikha was analyzing the situation she encountered a Tutsi girl which to Sheikha seemed as if it was a doll but in truth it was actually a human infant. This surprised me because i could have only guesses how malnourished that child was. In the end i think the lesson learned from this story was that depending on your decisions and actions you can save and alter the future.', ""What stood out to me was how we don't have to go through the daily struggles that they have to go through. In the US we have many benefits that we don't even think about and take for granted so watching this film made me think about how I can make the world a better place how they did."", 'The moments that stood out to me in the film was how unhealthy the Tutsi people were when Sasha and Sheikha flew into the Democratic Republic of Congo. I was quite surprised when Sasha agreed to help Sheikha because he seems like he is a ""by the book"" type of person. The film club ignited sadness in me because of how hopeless the people were. Even if they were able to flee for refuge, the people were leaving family behind. Some of the questions that I still have are how the other people doing and did any of them take advantage of the opportunities in America like free education.', 'I was shocked at how malnourished the Tutsi refugees were, they did not have enough foods and water. The living conditions is horrendous, the area look crowded and lack sanitary. The people lack many basic necessities, the situation appear hopeless. I admired the humanitarians efforts to help these people escape, it was a difficult decision to take the women and children with them. I was also surprised that they choose to go against their instruction because they are risking many lives. It is sad that they have to leave their friend and family behind along with their old life but they now have the opportunity to have a better life.', 'I totally agree with Iyanna Brown statement ""I was quite surprised when Sasha agreed to help Sheikha because he seems like he is a by the book type of person."" In my opinion I assumed Sasha Chanoff was a women who was a humanitarian involved in helping rescue the Democratic Republic of Congo in the beginning. However it turns out Sasha is actually a Man. I had to watch the video twice to figure that out. Anyways in the beginning the audience felt that Sasha is a trustworthy man so is ""by the book"" but toward the ending with a little convincing from Sheikha Ali. Sasha turned around and disobeyed the procedure, which gave them the ability to save more than 112 refugees. I found that part to be the most shocking, just like Iyanna Brown.', 'The Tutsi people, an ethnic group, in the Democratic Republic of Congo suffered from persecution, they are killed or attack by the government and the other ethnic group. Sasha Chanoff and Sheikha Ali are two humanitarian workers who help refugees flee to other countries. I was surprised when the humanitarian workers decided to help the women and children not on the list because this was an important and risky decision. They are debating if the possibility of saving those people is worth the risk of endangering everyone else. The moment that stood out to me was when Ali state she mistaken a human baby for a doll because it really emphasize the terrible condition that these people are living in.', 'It was very sad to see a specific tribe targeted and killed for such foolish reasons. I also agree that the fact that the baby was as small as a baby doll was very saddening and it made me take much pity on the Tutsi people. I think that Sasha and Sheikha are good representations of what being a humanitarian is all about. Sasha and Sheikha took risks to save the life of numerous people of the Tutsi tribe.  Although the moment is still bittersweet because they were taken away from their family and the life that they have always known. The video shows that it is only right that we assist and help out people who are less fortunate than us because it is the human and morally correct thing to do.', 'I agree with the bittersweet part because they are being torn apart from their family but it is the right thing to do in order for them to live a better life.', 'This is heartbreaking.', 'Judy Fedorchak i totally agree with your statement that this documentary was heartbreaking. I cannot fathom in a million years how any human being can go through was the great and resilient Tutsi people have gone through. This is because no one human being to be subject to persecution from their government which has a duty and obligation to protect and defend their people not to criminalize and kill them such as the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

]",The decision to move the Raiders to Las Vegas from Oakland presents conflicts for a league that has long opposed gambling.,"[""Money has corrupted sports at least down to and including the college level. It would not surprise me that it's already deep into high schools. Gambling is one aspect of this but so is the amount of money paid to coaches and to recruit players as well as other costs of different sports. For the most part people seem to see nothing wrong with this, especially if it has to do with the team that they follow or support. At the professional level one of the saddest things is how money even controls where teams call home. It has nothing to do with the fans and the tradition that the people of a city find important. It boils down to what the sports oligarchs happen to decide, like Jerry Jones of Dallas being a prime backer of Oakland's move to Las Vegas. Just another aspect of American life where real people are ignored by the 1%."", 'The NFL scheduled four games in London in 2017. You can literally walk around the corner into a betting shop and place different types of wagers on a game. Teams are flown to London many days before a game.  The NFL has been scheduling games in London for years. Roger- It seems strange to me you have encouraged a larger footprint in London if you are so opposed to gambling on NFL games.', ""There's gambling and gamblers in every city and state. Las Vegas is at least open about it and has government regulation as opposed to New York and New Jersey where sports gambling is run by the mafia and where the Giants and Jets play. The notion that sports gambling only occurs in Las Vegas because it is legal there naively ignores that New York is the gambling capital of the US. Oakland, however, has the league's worst stadium and although the Bay Area is rich, local politicians are too cheap to build a new one. The 49ers are sufficient pro football for the Bay Area."", 'Only question is: Does the Mob still run Vegas. The answer to that will determine how all of this will shake out. Stay tuned...', 'Greed.... one of the 7 deadly sins...', ""The NFL is headed in the direction of English Premier League soccer. Not only is betting on matches perfectly legal, many of the teams' jerseys feature prominent online gambling sites. It's just too much money the NFL is leaving on the table."", ""I'm reminded of the old saying that money is the root of all evil.  Mass sports entertainment is taking another step in the long process of transformation from sports as a popular recreational pastime into something that will be ugly and unrecognizable.  Each step has its own logic, but already the outcomes include FIFA corruption, PED scandals in Olympic sports and cycling, absurd player salaries, brain damaged ex football players, under-the-table payments to college athletes, publically funded subsidies to privately owned franchises, fantasy sports gambling, the WWE and more.  It will get worse, not better."", 'Raiders New Slogan.........Just Cover Baby !!!!!   Stick that in your pretty pink skirt Rodge !!!!', 'Given what NFL players make and the fact that most of them make it for a couple of years on average, there\'s little chance of another black sox scandal happening. The revolution in labor rights in professional sports that started in baseball from the 1970\'s and has made it to all sports in one form or another thus acting as a check on the kind of thing that all pro sports leagues rightly fear. There would be enough of a disincentive in the form of lost income, lifetime bans and long term suspensions to keep NFL players on the level. As usual with this league, the issue is more ""how much of the money can the business keep for itself"" more than anything else. Love or hate Roger Goodell (and like most New Englanders I\'m not a fan because of the way he tried, in my opinion to shift the public\'s attention away from real outrageous behavior by some of the leagues players onto the team everybody outside of five and half states loves to hate) but he\'s done a good job of making money for them and keeping the damage to their brand from a host of issues minimal until a couple of years ago after which the national lessons about climate and physics in New England began, the league sacrificed its credibility for most folks in five and a half states but won the national headline war, ate up time and thus salvaged its brand from the fallout of real scandals. Roger\'s focus on getting all the money for the principals not the players or the states fits perfectly.', 'For a non gambler, it is staggering to go to a Sports Book in Las Vegas.  It will only be a matter of months before an official takes a nice chunk of cash to ""just give me one call.""  Officials are not full time league employees and Las Vegas will offer many ""opportunities"" to make a few extra bucks.', ""The reason they want a national policy and national regulations is because it's pretty easy to grease 51 Senators so that the law, when enacted, will require a cut of the gambling money go to the league. It's pure greed, as always."", 'We have to make sure that we continue to stay focused on making sure that everyone has full confidence that what you see on the field is not influenced by any outside factors,” Goodell said last month. “We will not relent on that.” Wow. What a bold stance, Roger. Making sure your games are on the up-and-up. That\'s like a auto maker saying, ""We will continue to make sure the brakes in our cars will stop you when depressed. On that we will not relent.""', ""I think the NFL's relationship with gambling (official or otherwise), has gone well beyond the thin edge of a wedge.  I suppose it was inevitable.  Pity."", ""Everyone from the old school knows that before television, the main driving force behind football was gambling - all of it illegal save for the books in Nevada. It is a sad fact that the United States has gone from a manufacturing society to one based on services.   And one of the most lucrative services is gambling. Should not the NFL be part of this society with a franchise in Las Vegas?   Will there be a greater temptation to fix games with the Raiders in Las Vegas, or lesser since bets on the home team will be more closely monitored? To me, it just doesn't sound right - Las Vegas Raiders.   Let me tell you, during law school I knew a bookmaker who would literally make a valise of money after an NFL weekend.  The Raiders only play 10 dates a year, counting the exhibitions.   Are they going to have lines on those games?  If not, revenue at the sports books will suffer because the bookmaker makes money from the juice on every game -  no matter who wins. NFL football is still king, and the Raiders will have more revenue with this new stadium - as well as support from casinos who will buy tickets. I'd have to think the Raiders will hurt the Vegas Golden Knights NHL team - which will play many more dates without benefit of an ice hockey heritage in the desert.   Heck, their name should have been Black Jacks or Aces - why beat around the bush about Las Vegas and gambling?"", '""we continue to stay focused on making sure that everyone has full confidence that what you see on the field is not influenced by any outside factors,” Goodell said last month. “We will not relent on that.” So many NFL fans would laugh out loud if they simultaneously read that statement that the ""Beast Quake"" would pale in comparison. Ex-pats in Tokyo might feel the tremors. I\'ve been following NFL football (via my hapless Detroit Lions) for over 1/2 century. Goodell\'s claim is hilarious. There are more ""outside factors"" affecting the league than I can count, including the fact that the NFL lied about knowledge of the dangers of playing professional football for decades in its quest for ever greater profits. Do I still watch Lions games? Yep. Is that cynical of me? You bet. It\'s people like me who keep the NFL profitable. But seriously, Roger ... don\'t ever think that my cynicism means I\'m blind.', ""It's only a matter of time before the league confronts a gambling scandal. Look at the vulnerabilities. Low-paid game officials who are not fulltime professionals, lots of rank and file players without guaranteed contracts. And Vegas hasn't really changed at its core, it's just gotten an image makeover. But then again, the NFL is all about image."", ""Seton Hall should have queried whether Vegas was tarnishing it's reputation by letting the NFL in.  The NFL is only opposed to sports gambling because they haven't quite figured out how to monetize it yet."", ""Principles be damned, there's money to be made"", ""Pretty sure that's right there in the Constitution."", 'This is a business that has tacitly encouraged the use of the line and game odds for decades.

]",Who has had the strongest influence on you when it comes to making choices that will affect your future?,"[""I think everybody or at least most people can relate to a degree of what Ms. Mitchell experienced. I for one do feel a lot of pressure to succeed or achieve bigger goals. Mostly this is due to my mom and her wanting me to get into a good college. Part of this can be attributed to the fact that neither of my parents went to college and that some of my cousins have been really successful and are doing/did very good in school and college. Eventually I just started to ignore or pay less attention to these standards being set and just do as well as I can to satisfy myself. I'm sure everyone has been under judgement in some way based on a decision they made but if people are going to judge you there is no point in listening to them."", 'Yes', ""Pressure most definitely influenced Ms. Mitchell's decisions despite the fact that her parents' pressure was somewhat light. The fact that she was expected to do well in school and go to college shows the pressure that her parents and society put on her. I feel a pressure to achieve but the pressure is mostly self-inflicted. My parents try to lightly push me because they want me to be successful in life, but have given me the option to do whatever I want in life, whether that be going to college or pursuing a career right out of high school. I think the judgement Ms. Mitchell's peers placed on her when she told them of her decision to go to Spelman was a little unfair and might have been hurtful. In the past I occasionally received judgement for the colleges I plan on applying to or the career path I want to pursue, but I am able to brush it off and not let it influence my decisions."", 'In the community where I live, everyone knows what everyone is doing in high school, college, and who went to what college, and what grades they´re getting. Hearing my parents gossip about other kids can often cause me to be very neurotic and stressed out because I know the same would happen to me if I didn´t meet everyone´s expectation of what constitutes a ¨proper life¨ by attending a ¨good¨ college. I constantly feel pressure to achieve success, not only for my own sake, but for my family and what others would think of me.', ""When in comes to choosing a college, of course there's a lot of pressure involved. Everyone feels conflicted about their desires and the desires of others. However, there's nothing wrong with this; it can even be a good thing. In any decision that anyone makes, one has to consider the impact. Yes, I do feel pressured by my parents and my teachers to succeed. Sometimes, It feels as though people hold me on a pedestal of academic excellence that I can't step down from. But this isn't a bad thing. It's just something that I have to take into consideration. I often find the academic pressures from my surrounding environment pushes me to try my hardest - to achieve the most that I can achieve. Though it may seem as though you know the best decision for yourself, sometimes, you just have to acknowledge that others may see things in you that you yourself can't see."", 'I am the first generation in my family to go to college. My mom is always so serious about what college I will go to. Because I am an international student from China, my mom often uses many examples of other Chinese students who got into ivy leigh schools with scholarships to encourage me to work harder.', ""My parents put a lot of pressure when it comes to academics. Not only do they care about grades, but they also care about what college I should try to get into and what career I should take. Fortunately, my friends don't judge my decisions since they're more empathetic."", '- I\'m in the midst of narrowing my lists of colleges right now and have found that I find myself leaning towards schools with high diversity rates. I have some HBCU\'s on my list, but at a minimum would not mind attending a PWI as long as I found their diversity rates satisfactory. -I do find myself pressured to achieve at times. Most of the time the pressure is brought on by myself, in relation to what I want my future to look like. My family and peers are incredibly supportive and I\'ve never found them placing unnecessary stress on me when it comes to my future. -I do have certain expectations placed on myself because of what my parents have achieved. They\'re successful and always attempt to take on new opportunities to challenge themselves. This has affected me in a positive manner by inspiring me to go past my ""invisible threshold"", so I don\'t have any regrets when I look back on what I\'ve accomplished. -When Ms.Mitchell\'s peers gave her that reaction to her attending Spelman it shows people are unaware and may, at times, make assumptions about things they don\'t know. I have been on the receiving end of judgment. When it happens, it\'s just a matter of me knowing what I want for myself and acting on it.', 'Many students, in today\'s world, maintain multiple leadership roles and take on many responsibilities. This often effects the perception students have on their futures, while the students also feel the pressure of being ""perfect"" in the eyes of their followers. Admissions pushes students towards leadership roles, but not all students can be leaders. So, what now? In turn the leaders of today are put in the limelight as a hopeful model of perfect leadership for other ""aspiring"" student leaders. The pressure to achieve is often pushed on by the idea that the student is seen as less of a leader when they fail.', ""I relate somewhat with her college experience. My parents push me a little bit towards applying to certain colleges, but at the end of the day its my decision. I do feel pressure to achieve because of all the opportunities my parents had available to me. I don't have many expectations with regards to comparison because im the oldest child. I haven't received judgment for my college aspirations."", 'Pressure is a funny thing, it leads to stress and stress leads to infinite amounts of agony and ripping out hair. It feels like all I ever feel is pressure from everybody. My parents say I need to be the best that I can be, friends always want me to act a certain way, and family want a good kid who can do no wrong. For an example my father has been bugging me saying how I am failing my class because i have an 89.2%.""Hard work, I was taught, would ensure as many choices as possible.""(Doyne,1). I get it you want me to be the best that I can be, but it doesn\'t help when you always in the back of my head saying you\'re not good enough. Friends always want me to act or dress a certain way because society says that\'s what were supposed to do. I always feel like I am letting every living soul down and there\'s nothing i can do about it. I try my hardest and still its not good enough for anyone. I will forever be the second disappointment of the family. So yes I do feel pressure to make decisions in my life, every decision i make will impact everything.', 'My parents sometimes make me make important decisions. Like one time my mom wanted me to go to the school she worked at but I wasn\'t sure if I wanted to leave my friends. So one week I went to the school, tried to make, friends, and went home to think about it. It was weird they didn\'t have enough desk so I had to share desk with someone. When I sat-down in my desk I tried to be friends with the guy sitting next to me. ""I was in the eighth grade and my heart was set on the Northeast Ivies""(Skylar Mitchell 1).This is how I felt about my school so I told my mom and she was fine about my decision.', 'Have You Ever Felt pressured by family or others in making an important decision? And my answer to that question is yes. 24-year old had stated that her mom said ""you don\'t have to go to this school but you will see It."" this is an example of a parent who is giving light pressure. To me this is what some people need and this is also exactly what my parents do. Whether there talking about soccer or school they will push me to my limit, it could be that I can study harder or that I can sprint faster and score more goals. Parents don\'t do this to get on our nerves they do this because they see something in us that can only be brought out with a little push. Hopefully when you succeed you can look back and see how right they were.', ""My parents never asked about my grades. Grades were my business, not theirs. Now did they query me about my rather modest career choice. I think they would have been appalled and disappointed, had I told 5hem I wanted to 'succeed' at something. What a vulgar idea.  Life was about being decent to others and good manners. I'm 81."", 'My parents have always pressured me to a limit where I felt like my head was about to explode. They had me checking my grades, maintaining a clean record, looking for job careers. The result in that was me constantly worrying about my grades and me getting in trouble. If I even had a B, even a high B, I would panic and try my best to get it up. Sometimes they would degrade me when I did something wrong. ""Do you ever worry you\'ll let people down?""(Lee, 1). If I ever didn\'t meet their expectations I would feel like I let them down. Although I felt pressured I always thanked them for making me be where I am today.', ""Parents should be very careful not to pressure their young adult children into careers they don't want. There is a need to have frank conversation about various paths, but I have known many bright young people who were pushed to the brink of despair because they had been forced to go to professional school right after college by ambitious parents. Let them work for a couple of years then decide if that's what they want. If they choose to go then, they will be happier, more motivated and more successful. And they'll be on a path they want, not on the road to clinical depression."", 'I\'m sure that everyone has felt pressure from their family at least once. When Ms. Mitchell talks about how the school she was going to attend shocked her peers reminds me of my family. Every time I go over and talk about what i want to do with my future, my family will tell me that I should really think about going to college, get a bachelors degree and settle down. ""Do you ever worry you\'ll let people down?""(Lee, 1).  I do, i want to make my family proud all the time, but they\'re opinions on what I should do with my future is completely against mine. Despite how a person feels about what you should do, don\'t listen, but instead do what you feel is right because at the end of the day, its your life and not theirs.', 'My parents don\'t pressure me to make decision. They just get irritated when i take a long time. I will get the decision, I will think about it for a long time, and then my parents will yell at me to hurry up and make a decision. ""Have you ever felt pressured by them when it comes to making big decisions, such as where to go to college, what to study, what jobs you should pursue, and so on?""(Karyn Lee,1). I have my mind set on a college. Have you ever felt pressured by them when it comes to making big decisions, such as where to go to college, what to study, what jobs you should pursue, and so on?ASU is my college, but I still have and open-mind. I would love to take refuge at ASU or any college that i can get in to.', 'My influence was my neighbor, she was like a big sister to me. I looked up to her greatly before she moved away']","Some state that pressure is a good thing, and they don't let it negatively influence them. Others emphasize that pressure and gossip, especially among parents, makes a student's life hard. They state how parents judge and use examples of other students. Some students have expectations for themselves because of what their parents have achieved or the opportunities given to them.

And there are schools which charge an exorbitant fee that cater to this consumer base. It is a vicious cycle.  I believe, preschools across the country should adopt a standardized approach to learning, fun and play.  As a mother of a toddler, who is in the process of finding an apt preschool for my child, I know my child's comfort level, excitement and enthusiasm for a new place matters a lot and is the top criterion in choosing the right preschool. And for this reason, I think it is important to take the child along while preschool hunting. Observe how your child takes to the environment in each school you visit, assess their comfort level, see if they are able to mingle with their peers, while simultaneously analyzing the curriculum and daily schedules with the teachers.

There should be a quiet buzz going on in the room most of the time, but never does it seem like the classroom is out of control. There should be laughter, joking, and respect by students to each other and to/from the teacher.

I didn’t like the feeling it gave me. I was the only kid that was sad during breaks not wanting to talk to anyone else while other went to go do what they did. I felt like the odd man out so I would fake a smile and go with the other kids. I got really good at doing it until one day we were reading a book in class that reminded me of the one I lost and I just started balling tears. No one knew why I started crying on my desk because I didn’t tell anyone what had happened beforehand. Sitting there crying over the two loved ones I lost I realized that it is okay to be sad and feel grief or emotion towards the situation. I never really know if I moved on because to this day I still feel sad but now it is more anger to everything and everyone. People always tell me to talk to someone because it’ll help but I just get angrier because I can’t express my feelings without wanting to cry bringing up the situations. So with friends when they lose a loved one I tell them to talk to someone and accept the grief and that it is okay to be sad because it's normal. That it will get better over time but you need to give it time. I say that because it would probably work for me if I wasn’t so hard headed and a stubborn person."", 'For me, grief is something that never really took hold of me so I can’t properly explain how I cope with something that I haven’t had.  Or maybe my coping is simply ignoring the feelings and putting them in the trash like many emotions of mine, but that’s semantics.  What I want to talk about is how I think it is best to help others with grief (had a bit of experience from having family members of my mother dying every year for the past 3 years).  I agree that when helping someone, don’t try to tell them what to do unless they ask.  Always try to gently coax them into asking the question of what they are going to do in the future after all of this has happened to themselves.  This can help them process what they need to do going forward, but this should only be done after someone has settled down from grieving.  They need to be able to process the past and realize, by themselves, that there is more to do in life.  You can’t force them, but you can plant the seed of the future thoughts in their head.  It has helped for my mom, and a few of my friends when they are grieving.  In essence,  be a shoulder to cry on and someone to point them forward without dragging, pushing, or over encouraging them to move on.

I didn’t let myself be sad and instead I just pushed away the emotions and tried to act like I was fine. I didn’t acknowledge the fact that I was grieving, even to myself, and the outcome was I was incredibly stressed and was facing not only grief but anxiety. The article basically says that the way to grieve is to let yourself do so. You shouldn’t push away your emotions because letting yourself feel grief that is a step to feeling better. Like the author Megan Devine’s book, “It’s OK That You’re Not OK”. It is okay to not be okay, and acknowledging that can help you feel better, and even let people around you know so that they can help as well. There is no single way to cope with grief, so even if someone doesn’t outwardly look sad at all, that could be their way of coping.', 'In the past, I never did anything to cope with grief because I felt as if I wasn’t actually feeling grief.

My grandfather had been sick for a while, during the summer of 2016 he had a brain tumor removed and during his recovery he suffered a major heart attack. He spent 6 months in the hospital and in rehab trying to get better. Even after he came home he still was in pain daily. This article helped me to realize that it is okay that I didn't cry as much as my sister or my grandma. Now I know why I didn't cry, I didn't cry because I was relieved.

The best support I have gotten was when my two best friends just showed up to my house and just held me tightly. They didn\'t need to say anything to me, the hug spoke a thousand words itself. The worst is when I tried to explain how I felt to somebody, and they totally shut me out and made it about them. When I help somebody who is mourning, I try to have empathy. I tell them I am here no matter what, and will do anything I can to make them feel better. What I took most out of this article is that there is no right or wrong way to grieve. I always thought that the \'appropriate\' way to mourn was to just cry and be around your friends and family. Like one of the titles mentioned in the article says, ""It\'s OK That You\'re Not OK."" Everybody grieves differently, and that is okay.', 'I’ve seen so much grief throughout my life. I’ve seen my mom grief before, and many people in my family grief, but I have never exactly experienced it myself. I don’t think I want to experience it either, but when I do someday, this is what I will do to deal with the sadness. At first when people find out the news of somethings that happened that was important to them, they cry. Crying is their first reaction. I am pretty sure that I will cry because I know that it would be very painful to lose someone that is important to you. After crying for a few hour or days or a few times every day, I think that I would do something to calm me down and help me relax, for example, lying on the bed and watching cheerful things on the TV, and also I could make a hot cocoa for myself and eat some delicious ice cream. Then finally, after a few days or week, I will move past about the situation a little bit and go back to doing what I was doing again. If I don’t move past it, I would never be able to accomplish what a wanted to do. I wouldn’t be able to do anything if all I did was cry about what happened because grief is usually not something that happens only once or twice. Still, there are many ways dealing with grief. Some people just hold it in, and there are even some people that don’t seem like they care. Grief is something I have seen a lot, but I know that no one likes to deal with grief.', 'The loss of a family member or loved one can shatter one\'s soul. There is a multitude of ways for dealing with these sort of situations with none really being the appropriate way. There is dreading and weeping, holding it in and acting like it doesn\'t bother you, or talking and discussing the problem with someone which seems to work the best for most people. Keeping the problem to yourself and acting like it isn\'t reality usually leads to depression and can develop even worse from there. Like one of the title\'s mentioned in the article “It’s OK That You’re Not OK,"" it is good to feel misery or sorrow from the loss of someone and there are more effective ways of dealing with them. Approaching the situation seeking help and comfort can give the person dealing with the grief support and the idea that someone is there or them. Even though I think communicating with someone else works best, there still isn\'t necessarily a ""correct"" way of handling the situation.', 'Honestly, I think coping with grief is such a difficult thing I don’t have a strategy I could write down in words. Like the article said, ‘there is no right or wrong in grief’. Luckily, I have not experience grief when it comes to a loved one dying. The times I have I was too little to comprehend the gravity of the situation. It saddened me of course, but I don’t remember it enough to say if I had a strategy. However, I have many friends who I have witnessed experience grief. For me the best strategy for helping them is to give them space. When they wanted to talk they would seek me out. This way they didn’t feel bombarded and had time to process their feelings.', 'Honestly, I think coping with grief is such a difficult thing I don’t have a strategy I could write down in words.

This way they didn’t feel bombarded and had time to process their feelings.', 'As the article states, “grief is the natural reaction to the loss of a loved one.” Everyone experiences it once, if not many times in their lifetime, and coping with grief is anything but easy. It’s different for everyone and there is no right way to deal with it. I think the article said it all when it stated that “pain cannot be “fixed,” that companionship, not correction, is the best way to deal with grief.” Just having someone to be with you or offer their friendship in my opinion is the best way to cope. I think when people bottle up their feelings and close everyone out is when grief is the hardest. Just like the article said, expressing your feelings is one of the best ways to cope with grief; however, everyone is different, and everyone deals with grief differently. Whether it’s talking to someone, or just simply keeping a journal, getting your thoughts out is always beneficial. Some people might rather be left alone and others want the comfort of a friend. For example, when I was in middle school, two of my classmates both lost their mothers to cancer. When it happened, they coped with their grieving in different ways. While one of them wanted the constant comfort of their friends, the other just wanted to be left alone for some time. I think when someone is grieving, the best way to help them is to let them know you’re there for them, but if they need some space, respect it.', ""I recently lost one of my grandparents a little over a month ago. It was sudden and was somewhat of a harsh shock when I was told, but there was also a slight sense of relief, like mentioned in the article. My grandmother had been in pain for a long time, being told time and time again that she wouldn't live much longer, and how the pain her lungs caused her seemed to be getting worse and worse. Grief, especially when it pertains to someone in your family, does not have a negative stigma around it.  However, it is something that everyone must encounter eventually. Expressing your feelings is probably one of the best ways to grieve, no matter in what format. The article talks about great ways of doing this. Writing, talking to someone, or even just expressing those feelings aloud to no one are ways to help you get through the grieving process. However, being someone who has a friend who is in mourning, the best thing to do is to give them space. Don't rush them and try to hurry the process along. That can and will cause a negative reaction. Whenever I have been grieving, my friends did just this and I came out of it okay. Overall, this article brings up ideas and concepts that I think are great for treating mourning."", 'There are many ways to cope with grief.  Some usually try to forget and move on while others sit alone away from everyone because they feel like they have no one who will understand.  What I find interesting about the subject of grief is that everyone experiences it from time to time, but we feel as nobody could ever understand us.  It\'s a personal, psychological process that we must conquer in order to obtain the feeling of happiness again.  The only problem is, how do we accomplish this battle?  Many go to counciling to talk about their problems.  Some resort to addiction such as alcohol or drugs which leads to even more pain for themselves and the loved ones who care for their mental and physical health.  Everyone is different which is why I firmly beleive there is no ""correct"" way to cope with grief.  There is no ""deadline"" for when all the pain with stop.  It takes our own mind to overcome the challenges and to test our limits to what we can withstand.', ""Grief is unbearable. I wouldn't say I have experienced this to its fullest extent, but grief is something that is a long and painful process. When i was 11 years old, one of my family members passed away from lung cancer. My siblings and I were very close to him and he would be with us all the time. He was always smiling, always laughing, always telling jokes, I had never seen him without a smile on his face. I tried not to cry at the funeral, but it was impossible to hold back the tears. I believe that from this article I definitely have used some of these strategies. When I was dealing with grief, I used one of the points made in the article. I thought of the loss as a universal experience. I knew my loved one was in a better place, that it was for the best, and he was in terrible pain, and if he was still living, he would be living in pain that would eventually kill him. Everyone deals with loss in a different way. If someone I know is dealing with grief, I think its best that you always stay by their side, but also give them a healthy amount of space. After my loved one passed I wanted more time alone and appreciated it when people didn't ask me a lot of questions about it. I'd say that if someone is experiencing grief, that they should be with their family and friends and surround themselves with joyful people."", 'I don\'t believe people cope with grief, I simply believe that we each find a way of dealing with things. Truly we just either forget it not completely but to the point where it doesn\'t hurt us sustainably every day. That\'s is only in the case that you\'ve said you ""coped"" with it. so I would simply say I deal with grief and that is the best way and it was I usually do.', 'Well I just cope with grief by not thinking about it, or about the person that had passed away. Also I would just do what I like to do to keep me occupied and to stay happy. I am speaking off of experience because I have had many loss ones so just follow those things and it will help with it.', ""How do I cope with grief? In my life a few people have left me and it never gets easier. That first shock of them being gone is hard. You become extremely in denial and you don't want to believe anything. Myself personally when things like this happens, I find it helpful to talk to people rather then staying alone. I think you should get all the love and support you need during this time."", ""How do I cope with grief? I have been fortunate enough to have various loved ones in my life. I have never experienced losing a family member of my blood, but I did lose a family member. My dog Stewie, Stewart, Stew; a man's best friend. Stewie was an amazing dog. He was all you wanted in a dog, a friend.  I did not have a lot of grief when he passed. I feel he lived life to his full potential, whether he was humping other dogs on the beach, and pissing off owners, or snatching your pizza right off your plate. He lived his last few months like a stud too; he wore a diaper stylishly around the house.  I guess I cope with grief with humor. It helps me see my dog Stewie lived a incredible life, and it helps me to never forget him. I am not laughing at him; I am laughing with him. And, I know he is having an amazing time in Doggy Heaven."", 'As stated in the article, grief causes many ""common pitfalls and misunderstandings."" It is quite hard for me to cope with grief. I am the type of person to hold in all of my emotions, rather than expressing it. I do not like to talk about my feelings of sadness when it comes to grief. It takes time to fully heal from grief and the process cannot be rushed. Many emotions come with grief, such as anger and anxiety- those feelings are all common. When I am in the state of constant sadness, I allow myself to be sad, rather than to hide my emotions behind a mask. The best way someone could comfort me is to lend me their shoulder to cry on. No words are required or necessary, the thought of them being there is very comforting.', 'this is about greif and how it is used to people and greif is used for anger', 'Grief. A word so simple yet so complex at the same time. One word that sums up the sorrow one endures. One word that reflects the misery one endures. One word that represents the anguish one endures. Grief. A concept that everyone knows of but not everyone feels. How does one cope? How does one get through the day without breaking into tears? How does one get out of bed every day while feeling such distress? No one has an answer. You have to find your own ways to cope when you feel like all is lost. When you see someone who is grieving, whatever you do, don\'t tell them that ""everything is okay"" or ""things will get better."" In their minds, it won\'t ""be okay"" or ""get better"", and those words mean nothing to them. Don\'t just feel sorry for them. Put yourself in their shoes and understand their situation personally. How do I cope? I listen to music. Music is how I am able to express myself without inflicting others.', 'Sadly, I have experienced the death of a loved one in my life. This person I knew, and loved ever since I was born and I had a really strong connection with him. I was really sad when he had passed away and I really did miss him. Like many say, grief takes time and I do agree, but time itself will not fix the grief.  The way I handled the death of a loved one is by staying close to my religion. With my religion, I understand that I would be able to see this loved one again. This gave me hope when dealing with the death of my loved one. During that time I surrounded myself with my family and we were able to give each other comfort by providing each other company. It has now been 6 years since the death and I am doing just fine. Life does have some sad times but also its happy times. Of course I am still going to miss this loved one, but I always strive to think of the good times instead of the bad in order to move on.  In my opinion, the best way to handle someone that is grieving is to always be there for them during that moment of time, and to let them know that. By doing this it reminds that person that someone is there for them and loves them. This gives them hope to get through the sad times.', 'In my life so far I have been lucky enough to avoid the grief of losing someone who I was very close with. However, I am often the friend in the situation who becomes the shoulder to cry on. That being said, I still often times make mistakes and say the wrong things in certain situations. Over the past few years, I have learned that it is better to insist that someone is going to be okay rather then asking them if they are. If a person would like to discuss their life, they will on their own. However, your job isn\'t to know what the problem is, it is to simply comfort them until they are ready to accept the issue and/or move on. I\'ve also found that comparing your issues to theirs when they are sad, is a useless tactic, and considerably rude. A person in pain doesn\'t want to hear about that time you went through ""almost the exact same thing"" 5 years ago, or how they ""have it easy"" compared to what you had to go through in the past. Letting them know they aren\'t alone is a good route to go, but what I have just described is not the way to do it. Overall, listen to your grieving friends and/or family. If they don\'t want to talk about their problems, don\'t make them. Often times, talking isn\'t necessary. Comforting body language could be all that is needed to make a person feel safe and protected.', 'They tell you the only thing that heals a grieving heart is time. Clearly ""they"" have not experienced true grief before. I don\'t know if you can truly rid someone of grief. Time only makes it easier to manage the grief. Time makes it easier to push it down inside and try to forget about it. But it will always be there. Grief is a powerful emotion that consumes your whole body. I remember the exact moment when I received the news that would change my outlook on life forever. Those memories will always be with me wherever I go. We wouldn\'t be human if we didn\'t grieve. We all grieve in different ways and it is natural to feel hopeless when consumed by the realization that you have lost someone. If I have learned anything, it is that we shouldn\'t forget the ones we have lost and how it felt to lose them. Grief is a painful experience but in time it helps us appreciate the people around us. I think the best way to cope with grief is to accept it and let the emotions flow over you. After you let your soul wash itself of the initial shock and grief, it is important to celebrate the good memories of your loved one. I lost a classmate that I went to elementary school four years ago. I did not know him very well but the memory I have of him will stay with me. When I heard the tragic news I didn\'t know how to handle it. I was his age and it devastated me to know that he would not have the opportunity to grow up like I would. I still think of him often and use grief to honor his memory.', 'Part 2  The first day I just wanted to be by myself, I spent my days in my room, thinking about all the good memories, but that didn’t last for long. I like to be happy, and when I’m not happy I become stressed and even more unhappy, so I knew I had to move on. I slowly started laughing more and engaging in conversations more until I felt normal again.     Although Mochie was obviously very special to me, I wouldn’t know what to tell someone if they lost a relative. I imagine losing a special person in your life to be a lot harder than losing a pet, but I don’t know for sure. If someone I knew were grieving I would tell them to take their time, and then once they started to feel better, to go out and just do things that will distract them and will eventually make them feel a lot better. My family had already dealt with their grief and had felt better by time I returned and helped me by just letting me take my time and grieve the way I needed to. That would be my suggestion to anyone who had lost someone special to them, but you should let them grieve however they need to. As Julia Samuel said, “There is no right or wrong in grief”.', ""Part 1 I haven’t had to deal with a lot of grief in my life. I still have both sets of grandparents and I haven’t lost anyone close to me or my family. The only time I actually remember grieving was when our family dog, Mochie, passed away a few years ago. She was very old and had a lot of medication she had to take because of seizures, but she was still the sweetest dog. Being a German Pointer, she was pretty big and she would come and it in your lap as if she believed she was a lap dog. When she seemed to become weaker and older I knew there wasn't much time left for her, but when she did pass it seemed so unexpected I had just gotten back from an amazing week long trip with my class and when I finally got back to the comfort of my home I didn't see Mochie. I remember my mom saying she was sorry, but they had to put her down while I was away. My mom knew that I would want to see Mochie one last time, but she also knew that I wouldn’t want her to suffer. I had a very hard time dealing with her passing, especially since I never really got the chance to say goodbye."", ""Honestly My mother passed away when I was 3 1/2 years old  I honestly didn't handle it right at first but then I went to Grief therapy I learned how to handle it better and it really hurts still""]","All commenters explain grief is a sensitive topic.

]",Christian Borle is the eccentric Willy Wonka in this tentative musical based on the Roald Dahl children’s classic.,"['I guess I see far too many musicals and sometimes, the ones who get the best reviews are the ones I detest the most. That wasn\'t the case for ""Charlie Chocolate"" as I\'ve shortened it down to, which I found to be pure agitation and no imagination. Yes, the kiddie filled audience was going overwhelmingly bonkers over the whole thing, and my friend and I looked at each other every time the audience erupted as if to ask each other, ""Why?"" Christian Borle gives a fun performance, but somehow I wonder if he\'s wishing he was still doing ""Falsettos"" for which he got the Tony nomination. I wasn\'t a fan of ""Matilda"" either, so I\'m wondering if Ronald Dahl just can\'t be properly musicalized. As usual, the cast is filled with professionals who each get a moment or two to stand out, and I wish that the fantastic Jackie Hoffman would get that part that finally gets her the Tony nomination I thought she has deserved for several parts. At expensive Broadway prices (even TKTS half off or rush/lottery rates), you expect some pizazz, and the dull colorless factory set was an absolute disappointment. I\'ll give it credit for one thing: I did enjoy it somewhat better than ""Cats"", but that is not saying much.', 'This review is way too kind. The London production certainly had its shortcomings, but overall it was both tuneful and pleasantly eye-popping. The Broadway version has ""solved"" both those problems. First, several charming, clever songs in the first act are gone - replaced by bland and forgettable numbers. But the greatest abomination is how unbelievably cheap they\'ve made the entire show look. Bare stages, with just a single set piece are the norm. There\'s even one scene in the factory with NOTHING on the stage as the actors mime their way through an invisible obstacle course. Pure imagination, indeed. But two scenes stand out as the most blatant cheapskate-ry I\'ve ever seen on a Broadway stage. First, the fabled Chocolate Room, which in London was passably impressive. On Broadway, however, it has been swapped out with something best described as a Chocolate Terrarium - literally a 10\' x 10\' glass box that looks like a display of Easter candy at your local Duane Reade. The poor actors look ludicrous as they stand around it pretending to be awed. Equally bad is the Great Glass Elevator. In London, it took off to dizzying heights, even soaring out over the audience. On Broadway, it rises ten feet into the air, stops, and then comes back down. That\'s it. The greedy producers should hang their heads in shame, and I can only hope their cynical, calculated contempt for their audience bites them in the wallet. You can help by avoiding this abysmal excuse of a Broadway musical.', 'This is one of the most repulsive things I\'ve ever seen. Walked out in the middle of the second act. Took everything great about the book, and the 1971 movie, and ruined it. There was one line in particular that stood out, ""If cabbages were watches, I\'d tell you the time"", which is some of the worst lyrics ever made. If your thinking of seeing this play, DON""T!', 'I saw the show in the company of two 7 year olds and they thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the show as did I.  Christian Borle was fantastic and the show was engaging. It is nice to have show options on Broadway that appeal to children; after all they are the next generation of ticket buyers.  Not everything has to be Shakespeare', 'My comment is not on the show, but on a trend I\'ve noted in Mr. Brantley\'s most recent reviews. Just this past week, he\'s referred to actors (not characters) as looking ""embarassed"",  and suffering from ""a lack of conviction"", although he sugests it is not on the young actor\'s part.  I find this second-guessing questioning an actor\'s professionalism disturbing. It\'s perfectly acceptable to question the merits of a performance or production without suggesting that an actor would reveal to an audience that he or she was unhappy to be in said production, and would telegraph a lack of commitment to a paying audience.', ""I saw this show a couple of weeks ago. Borle, as expected, was great. The rest was a complete and utter disappointment. I left the theatre thinking that a musical that should have felt magical was anything but. Fortunately, I saw Anastasia this past Friday and that feeling I was hoping for with Charlie came in full force and then some. If you're debating between the two, head to the Broadhurst."", ""All hail Jackie Hoffman!  No actor is funnier these days than Ms. Hoffman on stage or screen or anywhere else...from the Book of Liz to Puddy Singleton to Mamasita and now Mrs. Teavee.   With all due respect to Donna Murphy or even Tyne Daly, she's the best candidate to take over for Bette Midler in Hello Dolly after the Divine one's contract is up next year."", 'delighted to have discovered her video blog on you tube. the woman is hysterical! i will see anything she is in! her backstage antics while in adams family are side splitting. kudos!', ""Johnny Depp was one of my favourite actors until I saw his version of Willy Wonka. The movie did have the necessary darkness of Dahl but it seemed just so ugly and lacking in charm and I've only shown my Dahl-obsessed kids the Gene Wilder version.  We all loved Matilda on Broadway (possibly my favourite Broadway show, ever) so the bar was set high and we were so hoping that this would deliver.  I need to read some more reviews first though; not sold on it yet."", ""Sorry, I just can't watch Depp's version...one look at him and you think it should be called A Clockwork Chocolate."", 'Took my visiting 9 yr old niece opening week. The sets were a hugely disappointing. Score not so toe tapping. Needs work. My niece was asleep by the final act.  I mostly agree with this review however the Oompa Loopa\'s ""almost"" make up for all the faults!  So well done and clever. They should give the Rockets the night off and let this little chorus line take over.! LOl.', ""I saw this show in previews with my two nieces and we all loved it.  I thought it could have used some judicious editing and perhaps edits were made.  The production is throughly inventive, we loved the musical numbers and Christian Borle is brilliant.  The reviewer needs to see this musical with young ones in tow.   I'm sure I was influenced by my vicarious joy in watching my nieces howl with laughter over the squirrel ballet."", '""In the second act, these spoiled young things get their just deserts..."" um, you would think that a writer of a review describing a chocolate factory would know that dessert is spelled with the double s, not the single.', 'Sorry, but pudding has nothing to do with it; ""deserts"" are what one deserves, hence the single ""s"".', 'While it would be quite punny to spell it ""desserts"", the phrase is ""deserts,"" as in things that are deserved.', 'Saw the show last Wednesday and in my less than High Brow Intellect , I found it to be what I expected and closer to a pleasant Surprise!

They loved it, even the darker moments, though some younger children seated near us appeared to be a bit shaken during certain scenes. So it may be plenty ""spicy"" for the tween set. Christian Borle can do no wrong according to the theater lovers in our household, so it was no surprise that he met and exceeded our expectations with his delightful and nuanced Wonka. So much is demanded of Mr. Borle in the second act, however, one wonders how long any actor might last in the role. We felt there were lots of lively and memorable performances from the entire cast, and plenty of fun new songs (not in the movie versions). The only significant disappointment for us was the choice of a minimalist set design, which was so skimpy that it became, ironically, a distraction. While we did not see the London staging -- and there seems to be a lot of attention paid to comparisons between the two -- we feel there is much to recommend about this terrific new version of the show.', 'Dear Mr. Brantley, You just retroactively ruined my entire childhood.', ""Did Ben Brantly pick the title of this review? I read somewhere that there is a totally different person who writes the titles. If so, did the title writer read the review? I don't know if Ben meant that the show should have been spicier.

The other half say they like the play, even the younger ones in their families. There is some discussion about the various actors in the play, with some focus on John Rubinstein because of his age.
